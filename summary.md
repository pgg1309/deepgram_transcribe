**Summary of Key Points and Insights**

The conversation between top economists and experts, including Michael D. Bordo, Mickey Levy, Steven Davis, and Stephen J. Redding, centered on the implications of tariffs and trade policies under the Trump administration. The main takeaways and insights are:

1. **Tariffs and Trade Liberalization**: The panelists emphasized that tariffs have been falling for 80 years, and the current Trump tariffs seem to ignore adverse historic analogies. The mercantilist approach views the world as a zero-sum game, which Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations and Ricardo's doctrine of comparative advantage refuted.
2. **Economic Outlook and Policy Directions**: The experts warned that Trump's policies aim to change the world order, which could isolate the US and lead to a global recession. They highlighted the inconsistency in Trump's goals, such as maintaining a weak dollar while keeping the US dollar as the world reserve currency.
3. **Implications for Financial Markets**: The panelists noted that markets have priced in expectations of recession and lower profits. They estimated that fully enforced tariffs could result in a $820 billion hit to the economy. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs has led to a significant increase in policy uncertainty, which is affecting business investment and consumer spending.
4. **Risks and Opportunities**: The experts highlighted the risks of a loss of credibility and reliability in US government policies, which could jeopardize the US treasuries as a global safe haven. They also noted that the dollar's value could fall, and foreigners might reduce their exposure to dollar-denominated assets.
5. **Signals for Investors**: The panelists emphasized that the current trade policy uncertainty is making consumers anxious and fearful, leading to cutbacks in discretionary consumer spending. They also noted that businesses are cutting or deferring investment spending due to uncertainty around tariffs.

2. **Bond Markets**: The experts highlighted that higher treasury bond yields mean higher borrowing costs for businesses and households, which could deter long-term business investments.
3. **Currency Markets**: The panelists noted that the dollar's value could fall, and foreigners might reduce their exposure to dollar-denominated assets.
