**Summary of Key Points and Insights**

Alberto Cavallo, Professor at Harvard Business School and co-founder of PriceStats, discussed the impact of tariffs on prices paid by American consumers. Key takeaways include:

* The breadth and size of tariffs, particularly on China, raise questions about their impact on prices paid by American consumers.
* PriceStats data shows that the monthly inflation rate has increased to 0.3%, still contained between 0.2% and 0.3% on a monthly basis.
* The aggregate index trend has been quite stable since December, with some downward pressure coming from sectors like fuel.
* Tariffs have had a limited impact on consumer prices so far, but there are signs of a more persistent change in trend in household goods and furniture, which are strongly connected to core goods inflation.
* Research on the first trade war in 2018-2020 found that the majority of the burden of tariffs fell on US firms, which were paying higher costs and not passing them on quickly to consumers.
* The size of the tariff rates and the number of sectors and countries affected could lead to a higher pass-through into consumer prices this time around.
* There are arguments that the pass-through could be higher due to the prolonged persistence of tariffs and the flexibility of price setting in a post-pandemic environment.

**Implications for Financial Markets**

The discussion implies that:

* Inflation expectations may be influenced by the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, but consumer expectations are noisy and may not be a reliable indicator.
* Market-based inflation expectations have been subdued, which could bring the Fed more worry about a potential recession.
* The effects of near-shoring or reshoring may take years to be reflected in official data.
* Tariffs could lead to reduced spending on travel, which might be a demand shock.

**Risks, Opportunities, and Signals for Investors**

Investors should be aware of:

* The potential for higher inflation in sectors directly affected by tariffs, such as household goods and furniture.
* The uncertainty surrounding the size and persistence of tariffs, which could lead to delayed pricing decisions.
* The possibility of a negative demand shock and a recession, which could impact asset prices.
* The importance of monitoring price stats data and market-based inflation expectations for signs of changes in inflation trends.

**Quantitative Aspects of Inflation Measures**

Alberto Cavallo's presentation suggests that:

* The 2% increase in domestic and imported prices observed in a short span of time could annualize to a significant number, but it's difficult to predict where inflation will land.
* The macro data suggests that there's limited pass-through for now, consistent with research from the first trade war.

**Comparison to Previous Inflation Regimes**

The discussion highlights that:

* The current inflation environment is different from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a unique set of circumstances, such as supply chain disruptions and changes in sampling methodology for the CPI.
* Electronics prices have not yet shown significant pressures, possibly due to exemptions from tariffs and competitive effects.

**Linkages to Core CPI and Consistency**

The PriceStats data is consistent with core CPI trends, but there are deviations, mostly due to services and housing pricing. The data is more closely related to goods with larger samples and can help identify trends in inflation.

**Currency Effects**

The weaker dollar in recent months may have a limited impact on inflation, as exchange rate pass-through is relatively low in the US. However, a depreciating dollar could make things worse from a pricing perspective.
