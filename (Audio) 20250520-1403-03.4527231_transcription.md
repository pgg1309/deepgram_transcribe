**Feroli:** on this tier at jpmorgan today i have the pleasure of being being joined by steve kamen who is senior fellow at american enterprise institute previously he was the director of the division of international finance federal reserve board in washington where he guided helped guide forecast particularly as it related to international developments and so today what we're gonna do is i think steve's gonna have a presentation that he's going to discuss i will kick off with questions and then audience members can also submit a question somewhere that should be available on my experience so with that steve great to have you with us and what's on your mind

**Steve Kamin:** thanks mike it's a pleasure to be here chat with you and your clients as you know for your time at the fed you know we we never say anything without slides although at least when i was there we actually you know handed out paper slides for our briefing so i don't know if they still do that but they might i think i am now sharing my screen can you see see the screen

**Feroli:** i cannot you cannot no we should probably should've tested this when we were chatting

**Steve Kamin:** we did test it before

**Feroli:** oh we didn't oh i'm sorry i must be looking at the wrong team screen

**Steve Kamin:** okay so can you now oh i see it sorry sorry good alright so what i wanna kinda briefly talk you know tell you what you already know about tariffs very little then i wanna talk a little bit about the challenges this poses for the federal reserve and then finally what i regard as more interesting issue which is the implications of all the recent volatility for global dollar dominance alright so this is just a list

**Feroli:** of

**Steve Kamin:** all the different trade actions that have taken place in the last few months i won't belabor it but just to note that i'll be referring a couple of times to april 2 which is liberation day when trump announced many huge tariffs that he then retracted in part on april 9 subject to many trade negotiations that are currently ongoing bottom line kinda looks like the average tariff rate relative to pre trump two point o will probably be raised about 15 to 20 percentage points this is a chart just showing that you know depending on how much people substitute out of imports average tariff rates in united states are likely to go back up to great depression levels probably not a good thing because as you are well aware tariffs are a supply shock they raise costs lower output i i've done some back of the envelope estimates of a 20% tariff hike and i have it raising inflation by about one percentage point this year and next and reducing real gdp growth in the united states by about the same amount so this obviously poses some real difficulties for the federal reserve as we all like to say whether we have any evidence for it or not monetary policy acts with long and variable lags so in principle you know seeing these effects of tariffs coming down the line the fed should act preemptively now so that the monetary policy kicks in when it is needed but how can it do that when it has no clue as to exactly how high tariffs are gonna go what they'll do to inflation and what they'll do to output this is not the first time that the fed has grappled with this problem i was on the fed staff back in 2018 when we were trying to put together our baseline projection for the us economy that we would pass along to the fomc members via our briefing document the teal book again we didn't really know how much tariffs would go up and what they would do with the economy so we really didn't wanna incorporate that into our baseline projection so instead we modeled the effect of an alternative scenario that involved a 50% hike in tariffs on everybody which is very similar in fact to what we're anticipating now and expect similar retaliation against imports from the united states so these pictures are copy pasted from a twenty eighteen teal book and the black line in these pictures is the teal book baseline and extension as you can see on top of labels and the light blue line labeled higher trade barriers is our tariff alternative simulation or as we call it altsim and you can see on the left that in the altsim real gdp growth plunges before then recovering base to baseline after a couple of years on the right the unemployment rate soars above baseline before again returning to it pce core pce price inflation soars upwards temporarily and then falls back to baseline reflecting anchored inflation expectations the fed's favorite assumption and then the right hand panel kinda like illustrates the complexity of the fed's challenge which is that in this sim the federal funds rate rises above baseline in response to the higher inflation and then falls below baseline you know as in response to the lower output and bigger output gap so the point is is that the the response of the fed to this tariff shock is complicated and highly uncertain now in the event what happened in 2019 as you can see by the blue line is the us industrial production softened significantly i think largely reflecting not so much the direct impact of the tariffs but uncertainty about where they would land and that eventually led the feds to reduce the fed funds rate the red line starting in 2019 okay but this was all possible because inflation had been below target and had been so for several years so there was really little ambiguity about how the fed should respond to the tariffs that of course is very different today when inflation's already above target inflation is much more politically sensitive owing to what happened a few years ago and by the same token inflation expectations are probably less firmly anchored as evidenced by the soaring five to ten year inflation expectations surveyed by the university of michigan unfortunately it's not just an inflationary thing us consumer confidence has also plunged so the risk of recession is also real although a lot of commentators are suggesting that the risks have diminished somewhat as the trump has backed away from the most egregious of his tariff threats but in any event the point is the fed's not gonna move either up or down until it has more clarity about where tariffs are gonna land and how they'll affect the economy so most likely we see more useless powell press conferences ahead why do i say useless because at the last one powell said we don't know what's gonna happen so we're not gonna move and all the reporters spent the next hour asking him well when are you gonna move and which way so with that let's leave behind this exercise in waiting and talk about another issue that as an international economist particularly intrigues me which is the threat of recent developments for the international role of the dollar now as you can see in this chart indicated by the red bars the us share in world trade and global gdp is substantial but not overwhelming in contrast the u s share indicated by the blue bars in global international financial transactions is very large in terms of cross border lending bond issuance foreign exchange transactions especially official foreign exchange reserves trade invoicing and swift payments and however you know right after liberation day a lot of things happen that have convinced many observers that maybe investors are moving away from the dollar as the world's dominant currency why do they think that well in this chart we show that right after liberation day the vix volatility measure the orange line soared and a few days later us treasury yields soared as well and that's unusual because treasuries are a flight to safety asset and when volatility goes up usually investors pile into it and yields go down this didn't happen this time but there was at least a semi benign explanation which is that this higher volatility led hedge funds and other financial intermediaries who are highly leveraged to basically need cash in order to meet margin calls and stuff and so they sold their treasuries leading the prices to fall and the yields to rise this had happened before notably during the covid nineteen panic in march 2020 when again as you can see here about the orange line the vix soared and again us treasury yields rose as foreign governments and other entities again sold treasuries to raise cash but what happened back in march 2020 is that even as the vix soared again the orange line the value of the dollar rose as well and that's very normal because the dollar is a flight to safety currency and and in the context of all the volatility and worries about covid investors pile into dollar assets and the dollar rose but that did not happen last month right after liberation day instead as the vix soared the dollar fell further okay which is a real violation of its flight to safety rule and that's what has commentators hot and bothered okay and perhaps rightly so so you know updating to basically last week my chart as you can see vix has now fallen back to quasi normal levels so a lot of the volatility is done stock prices not shown here have moved up to nearly their earlier trump peak and but you know and the dollars actually started to recover a bit as well so but still well down from its peak earlier in the year so the question remains you know has has there been lasting damage to the dollar's dominant role or is that just kinda like a temporary kerfuffle so in order to address that you know we did what economists do which is to run a regression in this case of daily changes in the dxy dollar index on changes in the difference between us and foreign two year treasury yields differences in yield slopes between us and our major trading partners daily changes in the vix and an error correction term that i'd be delighted to talk about during q and a or not so anyway we took our daily regression and we looked at the residuals which is to say the difference between actual changes in the dollar and what the model predicted and these are shown here it looks like a bouncy mess because the dollar you know is an asset price and it's volatile but the thing to notice is that right after liberation day on april 2 indicated by the vertical red dashed line the model showed the largest and most significant residuals negative residuals in the entire four year sample period which is to say the dollar fell below the predicted value by the most and that represents some statistical evidence that something funky was indeed happening right after trump announced those mega tariffs but but then as you can see afterwards you know the kinda like the balancing kinda like went back into the more normal range and we can see this a little bit more precisely zooming in on the last few months and what you can see here is that those big negative residuals kinda like were concentrated in a couple of days one after liberation day and then one strangely after those reciprocal tariffs were paused a week later and then since then the you know these residuals seem to have bounced around their normal range indicating put in english that the dollar on a day to day basis seemed to have resumed its normal responses to interest rates and volatility so a more precise way to look at this is to focus not just on whether the dollar moved differently than predicted but how the dollar responded to the represented by the vix you know so we're kind of honing in on the dollar's flight to safety rule and so what you see here is an is an estimate from our model of the sensitivity of the dollar to the vix estimated in thirty day moving windows over the sample period and what you can see is that for most of the period that coefficient is very positive and significant indicating when the vix goes up the dollar goes up consistent with this point of safety rule then if you look at right after liberation day it dips a little bit negative but temporarily there's a bigger kerfuffle at the very end i'm not sure what that's about but but the point here is you can't tell from this chart that there's been a sea change in the behavior of the dollar okay we will have to wait longer to see what's going on so my bottom line here is that it's too soon to sound the death knell of dollar dominance and i kinda view the events of the last month as more indicative of what could happen if there are future policy disruptions and i wanna just acknowledge at this point my second bullet that it's a little too soon to see what's going on with the moody's downgrade but that bears watching so my view is is that in the event perhaps unlikely that macro policies you know basically settle down and you know and the and the trade talks turn out more or less as expected i could imagine the dollar retaining its dominance for the time being however that's defined but on the other hand more crazy stuff like in the week or so after liberation day i could see triggering more pullbacks from dollar assets that would ultimately degrade the dollar's dominance now i would note that if it's crazy policies that are basically responsible for the erosion of dollar dominance then the decline in dollar governance per se would likely be the least of our problems and that's where i will stop and i look forward to your questions

**Feroli:** alright thanks steve that was a really interesting presentation so let me first ask a few questions about the presentation itself so first of all your back of the envelope estimate is a point off gdp a point on inflation for two years basically is that right

**Steve Kamin:** right i so i have my little i i'm going into my appendix now and so i have my are you saying where is that from

**Feroli:** yeah more or less

**Steve Kamin:** alright well that's that's why i have this slide so share of goods imports in us economy 11.1% multiply that by a 20% hike that gives me two percent 2.2% of gdp i assume it's spread out over two years more or less at hockley so that's a percent point each year and so taking off of the fed's december sep which is before most of the tariff track has started boost inflation to around 3% alright

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** then the next slide says well you know this is pretty darn uncertain because i don't have like a big fancy model like you guys at jpmorgan so it could go higher right because consumers and wages are sensitized by earlier inflation or the dollar could fall which it has or it could be lower because firms absorb the markups or the dollar goes up or there's a recession so that's on the inflation side and then the gdp side pretty much same calculation yeah it's basically a tax take if nothing happens of 2% of gdp and i assume basically a multiplier of one and so voila so and again it could be a smaller hit if trump is correct after all and everybody switches to domestic production and it's beautiful or but i have a longer list of reasons why probably the hit would be bigger disruptions of supply chains higher inflation leading to monetary tightening greater uncertainty tariff retaliation and collapse investor confidence so so so that's where my that that's where that 1% yeah each case comes from

**Feroli:** got it no that's that's helpful so also on your and by the way for us to work we are not too far off from where you are and actually not with much more complicated model unfortunately

**Steve Kamin:** and yeah i did this in two hours at my pit at my at my kitchen table

**Feroli:** also on the presentation so i guess it's kind of a two parter on the trade offs that monetary policy faces in the world which you have you know as adverse supply shock when thinking about that trade off so we have that light blue line that you discussed which yeah

**Steve Kamin:** yeah i'll i'm i will say but i'll just go back to it

**Feroli:** sure so this was a 2018 yep 2018 '20 '19 episode and there you had that you know average supply shock and then on the the slide forward you show the fed funds rate which with a rising unemployment rate rising inflation in this instance rises so two part question one is should we just interpret that and like rolling forward do we just think about what your tailor coefficients are and then plug in your inflation and unemployment projections is that how we're thinking about policymaker views in the model of trade offs

**Steve Kamin:** well yeah i mean i mean look i mean maybe i didn't quite understand your question but the fed funds rate in this simulation is driven by you know by the by the tailor role that's embedded in the model yeah so so i mean so the real the real question is whether you know is the is how strictly the fomc would adhere yeah to a model that just kinda like mirror that maps contemporaneous inflation developments into a monetary policy response

**Feroli:** right

**Steve Kamin:** now it's interesting that when when we first presented this to the fomc back in 2018 several participants fomc members kinda said well you know you got this like temporary spike in inflation mhmm wouldn't the you know wouldn't the fomc likely wanna look through that

**Feroli:** right

**Steve Kamin:** you know and and so not jerk up interest jerk up interest rates so much and so kinda like and so therefore better buffer the economy against that contractionary impact and we said yep that makes sense and then i think in the next round if memory serves we presented both the higher trade barrier simulation and a look through simulation same thing but with the fed looking through that spike and and and in that context obviously you get a you you know you got yeah again well you know not runaway inflation but less unemployment and less output loss

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** so so that's kinda like what the discussion was like back in 2018 and 2019 which makes a lot of sense now today i think that policymakers would have an opposite reaction which they would say jeez you know your your model assumes well anchored inflation expectations but consumers have been you know very bothered by the inflationary spike you know in 2022 and 2023 and we've already seen that the survey measures have inflation expectations soaring so wouldn't you want to relax you know basically build in a model where there's a little bit more second round effects

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** of of the tariff on inflation and which we actually give you more of a fed funds rate response

**Feroli:** yeah yeah so right so you mentioned that in 1819 the the model response here the blue line was hiking but in fact they cut and you attribute that to the i guess it was a two parter one is the low inflation the other is maybe the the weaker than expected output perhaps due to the uncertainty

**Steve Kamin:** yeah the i mean i think it's important to keep in mind that the that for all the human cry about tariffs back in 2018 and 2019 mhmm the actual you know the the trade weighted level of tariffs for the entire economy did not rise very much like i think a couple of percentage points so and and given that the us economy is moderately closed as evidenced by that you know what is it 11.1% of you know share of gdp given that the you know the impact on actual prices and and quantities and supply chains was relatively small what was depressing output was actually the uncertainty leading to lower investment industrial activity

**Feroli:** yeah right so yeah so i guess the upshot here is given the comparisons perhaps we should be a little more or the markets i suppose should be a little more recognizing a powell's inertia here because of the the state inflation expectation relative to that

**Steve Kamin:** well they yeah they should be i'm not sure like how that differs from how the market's viewing it now

**Feroli:** yeah right i guess yeah fair i guess another you know comparison and this one's gonna be getting away from the model quite a bit but in twenty eighteen nineteen was when the first time in decades that the that the fed had to deal with you know president entering them policy arguably that's going to be worse in the months ahead now i know what the i know what the standard answer here is that that's not going to affect their thinking at all i mean do you think that will that and certainly i think powell has you know shown that in his actions like do you think that for the committee as a whole do you think this kind of biases on one way or the other you

**Steve Kamin:** know it's a interesting and difficult question yeah i i guess what i would see is you could imagine some like warring impulses within the fomc mhmm with some members kinda like you know perhaps leaning toward cutting you know if they're you know if the beginnings of a recession start to manifest because you know in order to avoid more slack more more flack excuse me not slack flack yeah from trump or his other members and i'm thinking like bank presidents in particular who feel like a little bit more politically insulated basically kinda like having the opposite view yeah which is you know we don't like these policies in the administration we don't like the inflation coming out of it and so we're gonna actually lean hawkish yeah so so between the you know so so on top of the the fact that in an environment of complete uncertainty the fomc shouldn't do anything it's possible that the that the impulses to placate and the impulses to antagonize might neutralize each other

**Feroli:** okay so and i guess the bank presidents are historically skewed a little more hawkish than

**Steve Kamin:** correct

**Feroli:** absolutely maybe turning about turning to the turning to the second part of your presentation on you know what's been happening with the dollar so is it correct to say i know what your conclusions were but going forward is it gonna be the correlations that you're looking at between the dollar and this that is gonna tell you whether or not we are in a new machine

**Steve Kamin:** well yeah i mean let me just to i wanna flash forward a little bit to my model here i mean let me just say i'm kinda dealing with a con you know i'm dealing with a con i'm i'm trying to figure out how to interpret all that's going on sure and i i am not of one mind but it might be helpful actually to to kinda like show you this chart so what i have here is basically a levels regression so it's the level of the dollar on on the level of you know the us interest rate differential yield smoke differential and the vix okay so you can see in this level of regression that the model tracks the ups and downs you know the model prediction that's the red predicts the ups and downs of the actual dollar in green moderately well then you can see that that the actual dollar goes above you know the model prediction the red kinda like toward you know in anticipation of the trump administration and the first month or two right

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** and that kinda suggests that maybe about the trump trade kinda like pushed the dollar too high relative to the model and then you can see the dollar falling below the model you know basically later in the trump administration okay now the point is is that that could just be an unwinding of the trump trades it could be the recognition that that basically you know that the us economy is gonna be set by problems that are not fully captured by the interest rate differentials and the vix are already in the model so so they're more an indication maybe of worries of recession than anything else okay or it could be that that fall in the level of the dollar relative to prediction is act it is that rejection of the dollar's you know dominant role so i guess my point is is there's a lot of factors that make the dollar move up and down and not all of those should be construed as as reflecting basically ebbs and flows in the dollar's dominance

**Feroli:** right of course

**Steve Kamin:** and to put that into broader perspective the dollar of course has exhibited very large swings over the last five decades

**Feroli:** right

**Steve Kamin:** rising in the reagan years falling then rising again in the late nineties falling into 2 thousands so those broad swings again took place against the background of continued dollar dominance so so that's all by way of saying that i don't view like a like a dollar a a miss on the model as necessarily reflective of changes in dollar's role

**Feroli:** right

**Steve Kamin:** and that's that's why i like to focus on the response of the dollar to the vix and because that measures the flight to safety role and i guess i view that as being a little bit more closely related to dollar dominance right but my thoughts on this are still for me

**Feroli:** sure can you maybe go back to that chart in the main presentation on the correlation between best and the dollar and i think it would

**Steve Kamin:** you mean the the daily wiggles

**Feroli:** yeah it was like the second to last it was on the the

**Steve Kamin:** this one or that one yeah that

**Feroli:** one no that one one four one four yeah

**Steve Kamin:** oops hold on this one yeah

**Feroli:** so i think you referred to that very last data point as a kerfuffle

**Steve Kamin:** okay

**Feroli:** if if it's a thirty day window that's that should be as the as you get liberation day it moves into the thirty day window right

**Steve Kamin:** well the the after let's move it after liberation day yeah then you're moving into you know the thirty day the thirty day window is moving into and beyond liberation day that is correct

**Feroli:** right so so yeah i mean it's not unprecedented what we're seeing over the last thirty days i had episodes like that before but yeah as you say it's something that bears watching now one thing a couple couple questions that have been coming in i've basically been asking you you know you're looking every so far you know you've discussed this in price space is there anything in quantity space that you're looking at in particular one client said etf flows out particularly out of japan so kind of you know us us asset sales do you think this with the quantity measures or is that anything you're focusing on

**Steve Kamin:** well well i will i will have to admit i have not been focusing on quantity measures that's in part i don't have i don't have access to a lot to as many quantity measures as i did when i was working for the fed but also just my inclination is that there's a lot of let's do this there's a lot of flow measures out there right close into and out of etfs you know foreign participation in us treasury auctions you know there's there's a lot of stuff out there yeah and i and frankly i've always found it to the information from those flows to be ambiguous and confusing and sometimes conflicted so so i will admit that i i i find my comfort level in looking at the prices as like the final indicator mhmm more than the quantities but yeah but but that is not to say that there might not be some useful info in the quantities

**Feroli:** yeah yeah no i i tend to agree with with that i think in markets for for whatever reason people really focus on the quantities so maybe turning to something entirely different you know i think when we when we set up this call a few weeks ago there was a lot of investor focus on our law enforcement boards it seems like the focus had you know dimmed a little bit as some you know administration officials have kinda downplayed that but but in any event i know maybe a month or two ago you had a piece in the feet a year in the u of m are a lot going forward maybe you can just recap the main points on that

**Steve Kamin:** sure so my article was based on this paper that the current head of the council of economic advisors stephen marin wrote back in november shortly after the election you know before he was even nominated to that post it was a very long and slightly rambling paper but it proposed a lot of you know fairly novel and provocative kinda like both analyses and policy solutions so the problem that he identified was that because of the dominant role of the dollar the dollar's value was overvalued that had not only led to trade deficits in the united states which is not a crazy idea but also to the decline in us manufacturing which is a little crazier and and and and so then he proposed various solutions okay and they involve like coordinated intervention with our trading partners to to basically you know intervene to you know basically sell the dollar by foreign currencies in order to get the dollar down and then you know if they didn't wanna do it then we would bully them with tariffs and maybe withdraw of our military support in the event of conflict on top of that recognizing that these intervention sales of dollars could raise us interest rates he proposed that that be coupled with foreign governments basically extending you know the maturity of their remaining dollar holdings so they would hold more thirty year treasuries less two year treasuries so all again under threat and then on top of that like more extreme ideas like imposing a a user fee on treasury interest payments you know if our if our so called allies didn't cooperate and even kinda like pausing repayments for noncooperative places like china so you know so in my article i noted first that you know that undoubtedly the causes of us manufacturing decline were were not the overvalued dollar lots of foreign economies even those running trade surpluses had experienced a decline to share of jobs in manufacturing and then on top of that i noted that a lot of his solutions to the problem would be extremely disruptive you know to international financial markets and going back to our usual theme lead to the damage of the dollar's international standing

**Feroli:** yeah actually i think you can stop sharing the screen now

**Steve Kamin:** okay sure

**Feroli:** yeah so i recall though a a bit of the concern about the mirroring piece was the effectiveness of intervention to limit or depress the value of the dollar and maybe and i think some of the criticism was that it was making false comparisons with deposit cords in terms of the likely effectiveness can you maybe discuss that a little bit

**Steve Kamin:** sure so the well the let's put it this way most studies of foreign exchange intervention

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** suggest that unless you you accompany foreign exchange intervention with kind of supportive monetary policies you're not gonna get a big and sustained impact of the intervention on the value of currencies okay so so if you really wanted to make a foreign exchange intervention to lower the dollar effective then the fed would have to lower interest rates relative to what it otherwise would have done and foreign economies would have to raise interest rates again relative to what they would have already done and that's generally considered a nonstarter okay i may you know depending on circumstances you know maybe the fed might be inclined to lower interest rates right now but but europe and japan certainly have no interest in raising their interest rates in order to basically boost their currencies because their inflation rates are well europe's inflation rate's coming down and both economies are relatively weak and so interestingly the stephen marin article from back in november really doesn't even go there doesn't even broach supportive monetary policies because it knows that independent central banks aren't gonna do it so then you know some folks in favor of these what are called sterilized foreign exchange operations which is say ones ones where you nullify any impact on the money supplies they say well it worked in the plaza in lieu of accords because during the plaza accord when the dollar was so high they did it and the dollar started coming down and then they did the louvre accord to prevent the dollar from falling further and it sort of did but i think i think most people kinda like view those accords as being well timed

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** in the sense of you know basically occurring around the peak and trough of a cycle that might have generally occurred anyway so i don't know if there's that much information in that episode

**Feroli:** right switching gears a little bit this has kind of been the spring of you know books on the dollar including ken ken rogoff there was also paul bluestein had a book called king dollar where you know he had a similar i think similar takeaway from you which is that the dot unless we really keep shooting ourselves in the foot the dollar you know has a lot of incumbent advantages but one that he was really focused on was the weaponization of the dollar and sanctions unilateral sanctions and that if we kept going to this well too often that other countries would build up their efforts to have payment systems resilient to us efforts to weaponize the dollar you know that's been discussed among the brits i guess amongst them african asian nations can you maybe discuss your views on that

**Steve Kamin:** sure by the way i've written a fair number of articles all basically saying that with my colleague mark sobel who was a official at treasury of the imf before like me going out into you know the land of retirement and and and in those articles we all make the point you know that you know that you know that sanctions you know financial sanctions should be imposed prudently cautiously and in cooperation with our allies and that if we instead impose these sanctions you can call it imprudently aggressively unilaterally and recklessly then that too could drive you know could drive countries away from using the dollar and maybe using the chinese rmb instead so so so yeah so so i broadly agree with the argument you know that bluestein and rogoff have been making i don't think that reckless use of sanctions by itself would be enough to substantially diminish the international of the dollar but you know but like other bad economic policies and and you know and imprudent fiscal policies etcetera etcetera you know it contribute it could contribute over time to a degradation of the dollar's role yep i wanted to add that that you know even though the dollar is the the number one dominant currency and even though for example the chinese rmb you know only accounts for 2% or 3% of of global foreign exchange reserves there are a growing number of trade transactions that china's having with russia and iran other country north korea other countries that are based on the rmb mhmm and so you know i think i think we're probably already moving toward a multipolar currency world rather than just a unipolar dollar based currency world

**Feroli:** okay maybe i know we're probably about a minute over but maybe just we can wrap up with alright so we've talked about different risks to dollars and dollar dominance maybe you know what would be the cost to the us to lose if we were to truly move move to a multiple world in the various metrics you presented earlier in terms of dollar dominance maybe bring that perhaps you know i know rogoff in his book talks about the various estimates of exorbitant privilege on treasury funding where do you come down on this like in terms of the costs that would that would be entailed with loss of balance

**Steve Kamin:** alright so again this is an issue that mark sowell and i have covered in a couple of articles

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** i think what where i come down on this is that possibly one of the major costs of the loss of of a substantial loss in dollar dominance would be the ability to weaponize the dollar i mean you know the dollar dominance is what has helped us kinda like you know impose severe sanctions on russia iran other bad actors in the world a real degradation of dollar dominance would really impede our ability to do that on the economic front i would say that we get noticeable benefits from dollar dominance we get senior reg senior rich revenues from people holding cash abroad

**Feroli:** mhmm

**Steve Kamin:** somewhat lower interest rates some buffering of our economy against exchange rate fluctuations but they are not like overwhelming benefits and and so you know so the way i view it is first if the reason that the dollars became less dominant in like world transactions and stuff is just because financial technological developments allow people to use other currencies more easily that would probably be a plus for global productivity and i don't think the us economy would suffer at all interesting conversely yep if the reason we lost dollar dominance was because our policies were incredibly reckless we were bumming out our allies we were growing our fiscal debt to huge levels and casting doubt on our creditworthiness again so if those things led the dollar to be less dominant then the bummer wouldn't necessarily be the loss of dollar dominance per se it would be all the bad policies that had caused that to occur

**Feroli:** alright well i know we're a little over time here it's been a great discussion i know there are still questions that we could have asked but in the interest of time we will wrap it up here steve thanks a lot for joining us just had super interesting conversation thanks everyone for dialing in for all your questions and hope to see everyone soon

**Steve Kamin:** thanks it's a real pleasure chatting with your people and answering their interesting questions

**Feroli:** thank you steve
