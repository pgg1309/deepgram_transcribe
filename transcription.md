**John Moolenaar:** thank

**Raja Krishnamoorthi:** you thank you very much thank you chairman for allowing me to introduce both you as well as our distinguished guest today stephen kotkin confession from the start i'm a super fan of professor kotkin one of the foremost historians in in the world with regard to great power competition as well as authoritarian regimes including in the former soviet union the current russian federation and of course the chinese communist party i should tell you professor kotkin my wife is also a superfan she's an anesthesiologist the joke is that we both put people to sleep she's actually taking a little break in between operations from the or to watch this particular webinar and i think a lot of people from hopefully around the community both in in stanford but also people who pay close attention to our committee are watching today i'll just say a little bit more about professor kotkin he's a senior fellow at the hoover institution and a professor of history and international affairs emeritus at princeton university he has written award winning books on joseph stalin and the soviet union and i think that his insights with regard to the chinese communist party and xi jinping in particular based on his knowledge of this former soviet union but also current affairs both in russia and in china are extremely insightful and so it gives me great pleasure to welcome him to our committee and of course i'd like to introduce our chairman and my friend john molnar of michigan as well

**John Moolenaar:** well thank you raja and it's always good to be with you appreciate your leadership for our committee and it's just really important as we continue to work in a bipartisan way to really focus on the threat of the chinese communist party and the economic front the military front as well as human rights and you've been a great partner in this effort and i really appreciate the opportunity to be with you today and also to engage with professor kotkin and and you know one of the things that you know we talk about some and i know professor cochran's been a real leader on is is the fact that we're basically in a second cold war and that's shocking when you think of it but at the same time it's it's better than a hot war and it says that there are things that we can do to prevent a hot war and the stakes are different now back in the first cold war the tanks missiles the iron curtain were all very visible now the challenge is more complex it's economic technology information ideology all wrapped up in the ambitions of a regime that really seeks to reshape the global order on its own terms and you know when you think about the days of the you know movies about the kgb and the russian influence that seemed very clear there's really no counterpart in the sense of the kgb villain no household name for the china ministry of state security but clearly the chinese surveillance and operations are are very clear around the world in the united states and you know i professor packard you've argued that americans need to consider a real sacrifice higher prices lost apps national service because this is so serious i wanna dig into that more with you today and really understand your views on on the threat as well as what we as americans need to do to continue to bring light to this issue but sacrifices we may need to make to continue to advocate and fight for our way of life so it's an honor to be with you all today and thanks so much

**Stephen Kotkin:** it's a great honor the invitation chairman john and ranking member raja and i commend you for the vital work that you're doing in our congress on behalf of us all of us the american people let me offer just two opening bullet points to start the conversation and then we'll see where you guys wanna take it the first bullet point will be about the nature of the system and its its specificity and the second will be about its intentions aims motivations there's something called a leninist regime or a leninist system which is based upon the monopoly of the communist party and the insertion of the communist party into all institutions public and private that's something that is unique to the leninist regimes not every leninist regime is identical there are cultural differences and historical legacies to consider but there's a basic pattern and that's what i just like to clarify in the first bullet point you cannot be half communist just like you cannot be half pregnant you either have the full monopoly of the communist party or your system unravels we saw this in hungary in 1956 when they began to try to open up the political system to democratize the communist party's rule we saw it in czechoslovakia in 1968 we saw it with gorbachev in the soviet union in the 1980s the chinese communist regime studies this history it's one of the main subjects for all party members it's a critical subject that the party schools that all the cadre attend so they know this history well and the reason they study it is because they will not repeat it that is to say they will not engage in political opening because there is what we call no political reform equilibrium in a communist system what i mean is that if you start to open up there's no way to stabilize a reformed opened up communist party system because you lose your monopoly again you can't be half communist what that means is that you say we're gonna have debate within the communist party we're gonna liberalize the system somewhat and allow some debate in the party and some smart aleck comes along and says well i want a different party i don't want the communist party and you say no no no no debate within the party's monopoly and that and that person and others begin to insist that yes okay debate but debate means not retaining the communist monopoly but overthrowing it so it becomes a kind of unintentional suicide to engage in political reform in a leninist system as hungary czechoslovakia and the soviet union showed because again there's no place where you can stop the process and be stable again with an opened or partially opened political system because people in the system don't want the communist monopoly if you open it up and let them talk about that they wanna form other parties we've seen that again and again in each historical case and as i said the chinese are experts on this history even economic reform which is possible in a communist system presents a threat so they can do unlike political reform they can do a significant amount of economic opening economic liberalization they need the private sector like oxygen it provides the wealth it provides the jobs it drives their gdp growth and their employment numbers but they don't like independent sources of wealth and power which is what the private sector gives you and so they're constantly in this quandary of being desperate to encourage private sector dynamism but being threatened their monopoly on power being threatened by the private sector's success independent sources of wealth and power jiang zemin tried to square this circle with what he called the three represents he was the leader after deng xiaoping and by the three represents he meant that private sector business people would be allowed to become members of the party in other words we would co opt the private sector and regain control over it for the party for the party's monopoly by admitting them into the party this failed it only further increased the corruption around the party's position and so jiang zemin's three represents bring the businessmen into the party failed and so predictably xi jinping decided to put the party back into the private businesses as a form of control instead of co opting the businesses into the party force private businesses to accept party supervision inside their boards and often with their higher management structure so that's the stage we are now the upshot of all of this is that the communist party has self imposed limits on what it can do politically and how much it can open up and that includes even the economy so when we talked about the engagement policy and potentially transforming or helping to encourage the transformation of the communist party to a more open potentially rule of law direction we neglected to understand that that's suicide for a leninist regime because you can't be half communist you can't open up and survive to open up politically is a suicidal path and they're not gonna commit suicide in fact deng xiaoping never promised that he would liberalize the system politically and he never did so and and xi jinping even more so okay so that's my first bullet point that we must be realistic about the nature of the system and its limitations if we're gonna engage with them in diplomacy deal making etcetera what they cannot do is what we've been asking them to do for multiple decades which is to open up their system politically and move towards rule of law because that threatens the system's existence okay point number two bullet point number two what are the aims the key goals of such a system well clearly it is survival the survival of the party's monopoly and xi jinping but not only xi jinping alone is committed to the survival of the party no matter what as anybody would be if they were in charge of that system the second goal however is to restore the perceived greatness of china more broadly and so these two reinforce each other make the world safe for the communist monopoly and remake the world not just so that the regime survives but that china attains its rightful place in the world and so we have this debate in our country about what does china really want you know what does xi jinping really want does he just want to regain china's dominance in east asia does he want global power and that's a false question because the appetite chairman john and ranking member roger the appetite always grows in the eating and so whatever your initial aims might be if you succeed in them you get hungrier and hungrier and hungrier the appetite grows in the eating so whether xi jinping personally envisions east asian dominance alone or a more global dominant position if he achieves the first he's on the way to the second and so we must assume as policymakers as i said that the appetite grows in the eating now the competition with china therefore is not a misunderstanding this is not something that we can talk through very easily this is a fundamental clash of interest and values the existence of the american system ipso facto threatens the survival of the communist party because it's a freer it's an open successful alternative so whatever us policy might be more aggressive towards china less aggressive towards china china has the same dilemma independent of us policy us policy cannot fix this dilemma for the communist party which is that if regime survival let alone regaining china's perceived rightful place in the world are the goals the us stands in the way when the us was formed in the late eighteenth century not long thereafter china went into the tank china had a long period of external but especially internal depredations and so for a hundred and seventy years or so from around 1800 to nineteen seventies china as i said declined went into the tank that's exactly the time of the rise of america to superpower status so china being the most powerful largest economy in the world up through the late eighteenth century goes into the tank america rises china comes out of that long tunnel in the nineteen eighties nineties '2 thousands and lo and behold america is there now it's a superpower when china had previously been the world dominant power america didn't exist and when america started it was just 13 fledgling colonies on the eastern coast with a population of 3,000,000 not the superpower that it is today so for china this dilemma is new the dilemma of how to manage american power just as it's important for us to understand how to manage chinese place in the world so again we can't assume that this is a misunderstanding for them it's existential that they somehow figure out how to make the world safe for their survival of their regime and how to make china attain its perceived rightful place and america stands in the way of that and therefore it's not our policy it's the nature of the chinese regime that is the challenge and so we can be more accommodating less accommodating we still have a challenge that's not to say we can't manage the chinese regime better or worse we can certainly do better or worse with this challenge but it's not a challenge that we can attribute to misunderstanding so therefore in conclusion to these two bullet points let me just say that we have to share the world with china china is not going away and america is not going away that's not the question the question is what are the terms of how we're gonna share the world are the terms the kind of internal repression that the chinese practice at home is it xinjiang or what happened to hong kong are those the terms of sharing the world with china or can we through better policies and investing in our strengths and in our allies and relationships can we help build leverage so that we can get more favorable terms in the prospect of needing to share the world with this leninist regime that is afraid for its survival and that has a hard time reconciling our position in the world with their survival anyway those are my opening remarks about the nature of the regime and how the appetite grows in the eating back to you

**Raja Krishnamoorthi:** thank you john do you wanna start off the questions

**John Moolenaar:** well first of all thank you for those insights and couple questions i wanted to ask ask you you don't use the term marxist leninist i'm wondering if you would explain why that is you refer to leninist and and then secondly what lessons from the first cold war with the soviet union should we draw in in this relationship with china

**Stephen Kotkin:** thank you excellent questions predictably chairman john so marxist leninism sometimes gets us into trouble because people then respond by saying well they don't really believe in the marxism they're not really marxists they're just faking it they're paying obeisance to the ideology but they're really just about power and about getting rich and so therefore it's not really a marxist leninist regime the way that the soviet union was ideology is dead and so the that's only a partial truth a leninist regime has a certain structure as i outlined whether people adhere to the marxist ideology or not and so you can be completely cynical about the marxism and yet you can have a leninist political structure with that communist monopoly on power now we can debate the extent to which they adhere to marxist ideology and that debate is a worthy debate but what i'm trying to do by calling it a leninist regime is avoid the dismissal that comes from calling it marxism leninism because then people say they don't really have that ideology your analysis is wrong marxism has two components fundamental components one is anti capitalism and the other is what they call anti imperialism or anti westernism sometimes just reduced to anti americanism you can actually throw off the anti capitalist part of marxist and you can stay with the anti imperialism anti american piece so all throughout the time that we thought that they were capitalists not anti capitalist not really marxist they retained the other piece of marxist ideology which was the anti imperialism anti westernism anti americanism in addition the anti capitalism piece never went away fully it was always there in parts of the party system and in fact you can argue that xi jinping himself has more marxist leanings than jiang zemin might have had in terms of the ideology again they're both leninist in the structure of the system so we can have a fruitful debate chairman john about the extent to which they're marxist or not but i think there is no debate on whether or not it's a leninist system right now on the cold war and the first cold war and the soviet case there are a couple of lessons one is what are the options for great power competition in other words if you look at not just us with the soviet union but if you look at history in the full sweep when great powers face each other what are the op policy options what's the full array and there are only four one is hot war which you two have already alluded to is the worst outcome and that's certainly the case hot war between great powers is catastrophic even when you win there were fifty five million deaths that's the minimum the low estimate in world war two fifty five million is a really big number it's a multiple of world war one and if we god forbid ever got to world war three we would get a multiple of that fifty five million and so even if you win you lose in some sense of course there is a victor and and a vanquished in in most wars but what i'm saying is that the cost of winning can even be intolerable so avoiding hot war is the game that is the uppermost to manage the second policy option is appeasement or what might be called capitulation where you keep giving in giving in giving in as churchill said you get hot war anyway even if you try appeasement because again the appetite grows in the eating so you think you're reducing tensions but you're only encouraging the other side's appetite ambitions to ask and seek more and more and more so appeasement capitulation is the second after hot war it also doesn't look very attractive to me the third is what i call pygmalion pygmalion as you know from the george bernard shaw play is about finding a street urchin this girl who's a street urchin and doesn't have manners and putting her through etiquette school and making her a lady or what might be called a responsible stakeholder in the international system this is highly seductive it's very tempting for us to wanna transform from the outside these grand eurasian civilizations that predate the united states by millennia whether it's russia iran or china pygmalion doesn't really work it's an illusion because they don't wanna be transformed by us into a responsible stakeholder of the international system because that's our international system they want to shape the international system not for our benefit but for their own benefit so pygmalion involves a degree of self delusion in a different way from appeasement but also unsuccessful so if you don't want hot war and you don't think appeasement works and you're you've seen the pygmalion fail again and again where you try to transform them to be more like you responsible stakeholder in the international system where does that leave well it leaves what you guys call strategic competition or what could be called cold war the beauty of cold war is that it's not hot war i think ranking member raja made that very statement at the at the outset of this conversation in addition cold war doesn't mean only tension there was a tremendous amount of cooperation in the cold war between the us and the soviet union in science in space in many many areas so you can compete you can have high tension but you can also manage the rivalry through cold war cold war is an achievement if we get to cold war that means we've avoided hot war and we're trying to manage this strategic competition in ways that are to our advantage again share the world but what are the terms the final lesson i would mention here is that we won the cold war and the prize was an aggressive russia so the idea that you can win definitively and then you're done that there's some type of hot war victory equivalent in a cold war is not true historically what you end up with is a different version of the strategic competition russia is much smaller geographically than the soviet union it's much farther from europe it doesn't have the same size military industrial complex it doesn't have the same size scientific and technical complex the same number of nobel prizes and yet nonetheless we find ourselves jaw to jaw with the russians yet again so i think we need to understand with china again that managing getting into a cold war and achievement and managing the strategic competition doesn't necessarily mean that one day you declare victory and you go home and you're done what it means is that you get to shape the external environment in ways that favor your system and your friends and that disadvantage them without provoking them into hot war and that you don't become more like them in the process george kennan's number one lesson was that if you become like the other side in competing against the other side's authoritarianism you lose losing is becoming and acting more and more like them they do censorship we do censorship right they put government controls over parts of the economy we put government control we need to play to the free and open society strengths the dynamism the market economy the separation of powers the the free and open society we need to be who we are if we're gonna compete with them and the more that we act like them in the name of competing like them kennan said the less we're actually winning and the more we have to reevaluate what we're doing so compete every way we can in all the domains that chairman john outlined but make sure we play to our strengths we remain who we are and and we don't become like them in the name of competing with them so there are a lot of lessons from the first cold war including the fact that cold war is an achievement

**Raja Krishnamoorthi:** professor kotkin that was that was a very illuminating answer i wanna i wanna talk a little bit about taiwan because we spent a lot of time on this committee talking about taiwan and basically deterring the ccp from kinda moving coercively with regard to taiwan you've spoken extensively about quote unquote rolling the iron dice and you know regimes making the ultimate kind of move on sovereign entities we saw that obviously with ukraine and russia russia invading ukraine and and then interestingly you've also talked about how historically you thought for instance in world war two adolf hitler was a gambler whereas stalin was more of an opportunist and a little a much more cautious and you've seen various degrees of that in different authoritarians over the years how would you assess xi jinping where do you where do you put him on the spectrum in terms of is he more of a gambler is he more much more cautious and more of an opportunist and you know recently he has basically called he's purged so many levels of the pla i've lost track he seems to fire somebody every other week under the guise of corruption i'm not sure if it's true or whether he's just taking out people who might disagree with him politically but nonetheless can you just assess xi jinping from your standpoint in in in in terms of history but also in terms of what you're seeing right now today and how we should be thinking about xi jinping

**Stephen Kotkin:** yeah great question of course many people are better placed than i am to evaluate him i've never met him some some many other of our analysts have met him or been in the same room with him and and followed his career closely so i'll just say the following the answer to your question was contained in your question calculated risk versus uncalculated risk right the gambler versus the opportunist so uncalculated risk what what we saw with hitler versus more calculated risk the opportunism that we saw with stalin they both wanna grab what they can but one wants to grab it without paying high costs necessarily and the other wants to grab it come what may whatever the cost might be including blowing up his own country and blowing up the world and so which one of those categories is xi jinping well it's hard to say because it's not like we have direct access into his thinking it's not like he's broadcasting his views he's sitting down and talking with journalists or he's having town hall meetings like our congressmen have with their constituents even the second and third echelon in the chinese regime have a very hard time understanding what's going on inside the regime the first circle the first echelon is very narrow xi jinping doesn't necessarily reveal to them what's on his own mind let alone to the second and third echelon he stays separate from them they only have access to him when he summons them there are very few constraints direct regime constraints on him and so figuring out his thinking is a challenge for the regime inner circle for the members in the second and third echelon but even in some cases higher than that so how it's gonna be hard for us as well but for us whatever his thinking might be whether he's predominantly a calculated risk taker and an opportunist versus he's willing to incur more risk our goal is to increase the sense of risk for him so often people talk about how if he takes back taiwan and quote reunites historic china then he goes into the history books as the great leader who reunited china and i say okay what if he tries that and it fails and he goes into the history books as the person who lost the communist regime in china what if he goes into the history books as china's gorbachev not because he tried to reform and open the party politically like gorbachev did and unwittingly committed suicide but because he was excessively aggressive took higher risks than he understood he was taking and therefore put the regime at risk so our deterrence on taiwan must be as you understand better than anyone better than i do not only military yes military is absolutely critical getting those tomahawk missiles into japan getting the anti cruise anti ship capabilities into theater planning the hellscape like admiral poparo or indo pacom commander and and everything else that we're doing militarily is absolutely crucial including in conjunction with our allies the japanese the south koreans the filipinos very impressive work that we've been doing and that needs to continue but also deterrence is political we need to have the message to the chinese regime and ultimately to the chinese people that anything against taiwan is to put the existence of the regime at stake in other words play in the political sphere make sure that our deterrence is both military and political that we message and we take actions where the covert are overt that show the chinese leadership the second and third echelon of the regime chinese business circles the chinese population to the extent that we can reach them that he's playing with the future of the communist party we can do this in so many ways we we need to up our game here in political deterrence ultimately these regimes are about their own survival and so if he thinks his regime will survive with an aggression vis a vis taiwan that's one calculus if he thinks his regime is at risk over that because it could fail and because the regime could unravel its legitimacy could be undermined that's a different risk and that's the risk that we have to enhance and play in political deterrence has to be at least as energetic at least as smart and at least as aggressive across all fronts that we have now having said that we're still dealing with one decision maker we're still dealing with one guy making a hundred trillion dollar decision effectively and so ultimately we have to be ready should that decision not go the way we hope but in the meantime we can affect that decision by raising the calculus of risk in the minds not just of him but all the interest groups and the society at large what that means is that we can't do this alone just like i adhere to matt pottinger and liz economy's views on xi jinping and the nature of the regime our colleagues at hoover matt pottinger and and liz economy i also adhere to kurt campbell and rush doshi's understanding of most recently in the new edition of foreign affairs of how we need to aggregate our power in order to manage this challenge we are a superpower across the board an economic superpower a military superpower a free and open societies an energy superpower soft power superpower but we have something nobody else has ever had in world history we're an alliance superpower we're an alliance friends and partners superpower we have nearly 80 relations treaty relationships with other countries some multilateral some bilateral not all of them are at the level of the defense pact but nonetheless we just have a huge number of people who are voluntarily entering into relationships with us that carry mutual obligations yes they need to be enhanced they need to be revisited in some cases to be enhanced and they need to be brought into twenty first century conditions whether that's on the digital side or other sides yes there needs to be a rebalancing of responsibilities all of that is fundamentally true that you can't just stand pat with your relationships as if they're just gonna continue on autopilot but that is also a superpower that the chinese by the way do not have and never will have because there's no trust inside authoritarian regimes let alone between them in order to have mutual obligations in a crunch moment we have that kind of trust in our relationships so i'm very optimistic that we can do this right rebuild the military industrial complex and get that military deterrence right that you guys are working on but enhance much more energetic on the political deterrence and talking about that risk calculation in their face so that they understand the level of risk the existential risk for the survival of their regime that's what gets their attention

**John Moolenaar:** well thank you professor katkin just to build on your comments does the policy of strategic ambiguity does that lessen our capabilities does that deter our ability to message clearly on the political front in this regard

**Stephen Kotkin:** very very good question again as expected chairman john so the status quo works for us it's the chinese communist regime that's trying to change the status quo the status quo is our victory taiwan is a self governing entity it is democratic vibrant open society and economy and its people even before what the chinese communist party did to hong kong but more energetically after what happened to hong kong its people don't want any part of communist rule and so that's a win our job is to preserve the status quo if we give the communist party in china a pretext for changing the status quo we are playing into their hands we have to be very careful whether we believe strategic ambiguity still exists is a good idea is working to our advantage what's working to our advantage chairman john is the status quo that's our high moral ground that we need to stand on and it avoids providing a war rationale to the chinese so if we change the status quo on our side then they can blame us then it's not them changing the status quo it's not them being aggressive it's they're only reacting to what we're doing so i'm in favor of the status quo and i'm against providing a pretext for them to accuse us of changing the status quo and therefore acting aggressive you know with war as we've seen in ukraine if you take it you can't have it you get a smoking pile of rubble what's happened in ukraine is the coal mines are flooded the agricultural fields are mined the metal factories are flattened in rubble the ports destroyed a very very tiny part of potomkin village has been rebuilt in those russian occupied areas but for the most part they own a moonscape so you take it you can't have it so the goal of the chinese communist party is not to take taiwan by military force because if they take it they can't have it it's to get it to have it and so they wanna take it without the military confrontation they wanna just have it handed to them for example like czechoslovakia was in 1938 the part

**John Moolenaar:** of

**Stephen Kotkin:** czechoslovakia handed over the munich pact so for them war is actually a problem too not just that it puts the regime at stake but then they get a smoking pile of rubble and so we need to message that as well we need to make it clear that they cannot win this militarily they don't get taiwan they get rubble and so we also need to be careful that not focusing excessively on the military aggression of course but focusing more as your committee has been on the quarantine slash blockade scenario where they enforce a customs post on the other side of taiwan not in the straits but on the other side and challenge us to run that blockade and challenge us on whether we're adhering to a one china policy or not by enforcing from their side the customs post again we can manage that it's not gonna be easy but we can manage that but we should be less focused on strategic ambiguity as the problem set and more focused on preservation of the status quo which is a win so if we elongate the status quo if the status quo keeps getting longer and longer and longer if the short term keeps getting longer until it's the long term that's a win for us that's that's the space in which we have to play and all of our actions have to be geared to that enhancement preservation of the status quo not providing a pretext for them to attack they will attack if to deny us a independent taiwan in law if taiwan declares its independence in law the chinese will destroy taiwan under the proviso if i can't have it nobody can have it pretty much what putin is doing in ukraine right ukraine doesn't have another ukraine putin doesn't actually need ukraine he can just wreck it and win that way and china could do that vis a vis taiwan to deny taiwan independence in law and to deny taiwan role in the indo pacific with its partners like the united states so i wanna avoid that outcome i don't wanna avoid that outcome through appeasement i don't wanna avoid that outcome through self delusion i wanna avoid that outcome through strength in the military and the political sphere but i wanna talk about preservation of the status quo

**Raja Krishnamoorthi:** can i jump in john

**John Moolenaar:** yeah absolutely

**Raja Krishnamoorthi:** you know professor we we talk about the strategic competition i wanna ask just two related questions what does winning the competition look like to you and what's real you know realistically and then secondly there's so much economic turmoil happening within china right now and i'm just curious how do you view that in terms of how xi jinping you know prioritizes dealing with that for the purpose of purposes of preserving regime stability do you see any cracks whatsoever anything that would give you cause to believe that the ccp would be concerned for its own survival to deal with that more than kind of you know moving aggressively on other countries including its neighbors

**Stephen Kotkin:** again that's one man making that hundred trillion dollar decision ranking member roger right so it's very hard to give an answer to that because he's the only one giving that answer and he himself may not know what that answer is or that answer may be one answer today and a different answer tomorrow right so hard to say china is an unbelievable civilization enormously successful culturally phenomenal the food the art the design the economic dynamism the entrepreneurialism of the people it is a remarkable civilization and what they've achieved in the last forty years in the american led order with america providing a tremendous lending hand to what they've been able to achieve but nonetheless they've been able to achieve it and we have to give them their due they are very formidable and as i said they're not going away and they are a manufacturing superpower and they have a gigantic pool of skilled labor that can move from one industry to another and they have skilled people in ways that we used to have and we don't have as many now we talk about bringing manufacturing back to the united states but we don't talk about who's gonna work in it where is the ai inflected vocational training where are the million new math teachers in the united states you know math is our number one strategic import which we import from south asia china taiwan south korea vietnam because we don't do enough math at home we only have a million and a half math teachers total for 340,000,000 people we need another million math teachers right now and we need vocational training ai inflected vocational training and so think about this there are 33 32 30 three million young people in the united states eighteen to 24 30 two million roughly about 13,000,000 of them are in higher education so there's 19,000,000 people who are eighteen to twenty four who are not in higher ed what are we doing for them where's the ai inflected vocational training are we populists or are we pretending to be populists moreover of the 13,000,000 in higher ed how many are in the ivy leagues or the ivy plus including university of chicago including stanford but the ivy leagues as well that's a hundred thousand so we have a national conversation in education about a hundred thousand kids they're great kids they're amazing kids i'm teaching them out here at stanford they walk on water but i have 13,000,000 in higher education not a hundred thousand and then i have 19,000,000 not in higher education so winning is investing in those people winning is investing in ourselves winning is making sure that when we talk about rebuilding industrial capacity we have the trained people for the twenty first century to work those jobs i don't have to tell you guys this you remember that america because chairman john ranking member roger we grew up in that america right my father worked in an embroidery factory and i went to school and here i am sitting in the hoover tower in the middle of stanford campus in silicon valley that's who we are that's what we have to regain and remember and that's what winning looks like if we do that if we invest in ourselves if we understand what made us great and if we get to a point where our friends and allies and those rebalanced relationships are good for the twenty first century nobody can beat us absolutely not so winning is not planning an american flag in the middle of chinese territory it's not the chinese vanish from the face of the earth it's that america becomes america again that's what winning looks like it's investing in ourselves playing to our strengths most of all being ourself not being like china that's what i understand winning to be you know as far as whether the chinese are gonna roll the iron dice or not again that's one guy making that decision but on our side it's a whole society making the decision of how to respond it's our universities it's our scientific establishment it's our congress it's our judiciary it's our executive branch it's our ngos it's our business community look at all the sources of power in the united states the more that they are energized the more that they are the level that they can be at the more we provide opportunity at home and opportunity abroad for our friends and partners the more we win

**Raja Krishnamoorthi:** wow thank you thank you professor john do you wanna close and and or or i can close as well

**John Moolenaar:** well i just wanna say thank you professor kocken and appreciate the hoo hoover institution and all the work you're doing and the students who have tuned in today and and really appreciate this discussion very thought provoking and and and raja thank you for inviting me to be part of it

**Raja Krishnamoorthi:** well that well first of all i just wanna say a big thank you to professor kotkin and the hoover institution for working with us thank you chairman john and everybody for watching i think that what is most striking about this conversation is that just in the past let's say 80 of history we can kind of glean lessons that need to be applied right now to both prevent a hot war as as the professor alluded to but also to win the competition and i think we can only do this on a bipartisan basis there's just or nonpartisan basis what whatever you wanna call it we have to be united because i think that's in part the the thing that the chinese least expect about us somehow they view us as hopelessly divided and i'll just close with this saying i i i guess wang huning who i guess is xi j the xi jinping whisperer he wrote a book titled america against america and we cannot expect to win this competition with the chinese communist party if we end up being what wang huning described us as tribal partisan and divided and we have to play against type and be the opposite now more than ever and so john thank you so much for your leadership in that regard you're kind of leading the way and helping us kind of be the best part of congress that we can be so if we can do that and be united in our approach with regard to the ccp i think that our chances of winning this competition go up dramatically and you know professor kotkin thank you for helping to hang a lantern on on that and and other important points today and thank you to our audience for joining us
