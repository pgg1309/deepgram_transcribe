**John Cochrane:** mike and vicky presenting then steve davis and steve redding and finally andrew grotto we start with economic history then we have economics economics and history and finally national security because this i'm kinda gonna plug you with that i especially invited andrew because that's a discussion we're having so much at uber is the economists who tend to be free trade and the national security types who tend to let's say not

**Mickey Levy:** and have other priorities in mind

**John Cochrane:** and you know aircraft carriers are expensive too so is trade so i think that's a discussion that we really need to have with that we're gonna go in order hopefully ten to twelve ish minutes each we you know we have an hour and fifteen

**Steven Davis:** i'd like to ask us to

**Speaker 3:** we

**John Cochrane:** do ask questions here we talk a lot but given the amount of wonderful material we're gonna hear if we could hold down the scale of the questions and the quote questions that are really speeches that would be lovely and and then have a little bit of time at the end for q and a so try to keep it in context and as short as possible with that michael let's go okay

**Michael D. Bordo:** so this is the title it's provocative and this this picture tells you why we're here the level of tariffs the average level of of trump tariffs bring us right back to where we were eighty years ago k and what this figure tells you is that we've had tariffs have been falling for a very long time we've been in a in a in a process of trade liberalization for eighty years and there's a lot good reasons for that and now guess what we're right back to

**Michael D. Bordo:** where we were what year is the peak i can't even tell you crap eighty years ago

**Michael D. Bordo:** the

**Michael D. Bordo:** peak's gonna be before 1944 it's been falling ever since

**Michael D. Bordo:** yeah yeah okay so again these slides are a bit provocative the trump tariff strategy seems to ignore an abundance of adverse historic analogies and i'm the historian so i actually put together five but they're not they're sort of hidden in here president trump's a mercantilist he used the world as a zero sum sum game for him an adverse trade balance means that we're being ripped off he wants to restore us manufacturing as it was in the mid twentieth century like prebyshev of argentina eighty years ago nehru of india he believes that import substitution will restore america's greatness like what happened with the smoot hawley tariff in 1930 trump's tariffs are provoking retaliation and threaten a global recession okay in the nineteenth century tariffs were the were a primary source of revenues as well as land sales and they were used as protection and they were a really controversial issue we don't have time to go through it but they were not exactly popular across the country and in a sense accentuated this schism in the pre civil war period that led to the civil war in fact because of the inefficiencies as a revenue collector that's what one reason why we got the income tax in 1913 okay also president trump aims to end what we're in today which is called the second year of globalization because for him it it it it it led to two things advance of china and the hallway out of us manufacturing if this happens this will isolate us now i'm gonna go on on about this so the historic pillars of of the trump tariffs all of them have been disproved in the past the doctrine of mercantilism that goes back to the seventeenth century viewed the world as a zero sum game and what countries were supposed to do was to maximize the balance of trade surplus they did this by the navigation acts that restricted shipping between the british empire and other and its colonies by all kinds of other restrictions okay and of course this was refuted in adam smith's wealth of nations in in '19 in eighteen seventeen seventy six and by ricardo's doctrine of comparative advantage another pillar was the infant industry argument which alexander hamilton suggested in the beginning of the nineteenth century and that which was followed led to rent seeking and protected monopolies and inefficiency as far as the revenues go they would be insufficient to finance current deficits and they would harm the economy and as well as generating inefficiencies and the hope of returning to the mid century twentieth century era of labor and capital intensive us man it doesn't make sense because it ignores the technological advances that have occurred and the fact that us comparative advantage has evolved away from labor to capital intensive to human capital intensity and services throughout the twentieth century have been replacing goods so all of this is is is not being accounted on the us benefits from international trade and relies on capital inflows to finance innovations and and capital flows are the mirror image

**Michael D. Bordo:** of the of

**Michael D. Bordo:** the trade deficit so it seems that the the tariffs address the symptoms and not the causes of the us problems okay so i'm gonna give you a historical perspective on this

**Michael D. Bordo:** i taught a course

**Nichael D. Bordo:** in globalization for twenty years i've been doing this for a long time okay and it came out of a conference we had at the nber twenty years ago where we considered all these issues and we at the time most of us thought this was gonna be great but there were some harold james and clive who predicted exactly what was happening today okay so the story is the free trade movement in britain in the in the beginning in the middle in the first half of the of the of the nineteenth century leading to the repeal of the corn laws they were taxes on wheat in 1846 and by the way i belong to the reform club in london when i go there and there's a big picture of richard cobban he's the guy that led the anti corn law league okay and and the reforms that occurred in the nineteenth century in the uk and then the cobden chevalier treaty in 1860 what it did was it created it reduced tariffs in a reciprocal way through the most favored nation clause and that led to a reduction in tariffs across europe and the free trade that came out of that benefited benefited europe and the us which was a high tariff country so in the nineteenth century the europe's the united states is an emerging country and it it ran large trade and current account deficits during a during a second industrial revolution and the rapid growth that occurred in the later half of the of the nineteenth century was driven by capital by capital investment by advanced productivity and by migration and a key part of that there are capital inflows both the import of imports of capital goods okay and then financial flows and these were critical to economic growth but of course at the same time as this is going on also there's a growth in immigration okay there's a backlash that starts at the end of the nineteenth century in europe landowners were threatened by new world agriculture and in the us workers were threatened felt threatened by immigration and that led to tariffs in europe the end of the nineteenth century restrictions on immigration beginning then with the restrictions on on on asian workers same thing happened in canada australia argentina okay this these two pictures this comes from chris meisner's really great book on globalization this is what i thought my course on so you see there's a u shaped pattern in globalization on the left you've got trade so world exports to gdp they rose from the fifth sixteenth century all the way through the nineteenth century they've accelerated by the reduction in tariffs in europe and by technological advance in in transportation so you have the first year of globalization it peaks with world war one and then it falls off like iraq with the war when you get capital controls then you get many tariffs etcetera and then it comes back in the second year of globalization on the right we say we see a similar but not quite as strong u shaped financial like financial growth growth of financial capital inflows was huge through the nineteenth late nineteenth century it ends with world war one completely ends through the nineteen thirties and then comes back in the post war and this next slide shows you the same show for migration in addition to tariffs the question is will trump's immigration policies end the era of the rising foreign born share of the us and you see again this u shaped pattern and here we are at the peak will that go down okay so i'm almost finished my part so what happened of course is that this first year of globalization ended with capital controls exchange controls etcetera in world war one then after the war the us which was always a high tariff country really cranked up the machine with the ford fordy mccubber act of 1922 and then the smooth famous smooth hawley tariff of 1930 which was the peak at at 20% that led to retaliation by the first country to retaliate is canada that's where i come from okay and that led to the creation of new trading blocks that exclude the us so the ottawa agreement of 1931 what it did was all the british empire countries in a sense lowered their tariffs between them and put up a tariff wall against the us and other countries did that so in a sense the us ended up losing from that policy that of course led to the great depression and the collapse in global trade and then my last slide is of course after the war okay during the war in fact in the us cordell hull was the was the the secretary of state and others believe that you know the collapse of trade and capital and everything really contributed to the war and there was concerted effort to create a new global order okay which the us led and we know we we're all familiar with that in trade it was gatt which set a system of of of of of universal rounds of tariff reduction okay bretton the bretton woods adjusted peg the world bank the imf and and then in 1990 the wto but while this is going under a notable departures to this that have important lessons okay because of the great depression okay which slammed latin america and also a fall in the terms of trade radish of of argentina in a sense proposed this plan of import substitution of using huge tariff walls to create new industries in argentina all the latins took this on and that this followed like seventy years of complete stagnation india when it became a country the independent followed exactly the same pattern their economies floundered so i'm gonna turn this over now to mickey who's gonna really bring it to the present

**Speaker 8:** you did mention alexander hamilton

**Nichael D. Bordo:** i did mention him

**Speaker 8:** oh i got it later i had talked to him

**Nichael D. Bordo:** he said he he's the in the industry guy

**Speaker 8:** yeah for that yeah no i sheriff

**Speaker 6:** seemed to have worked yeah

**Mickey Levy:** so what i'm going to describe is basically what what we and the economy of financial markets are now living through and are going to face so trump's policies basically you know they aim to change the world order and in addition to to tariffs trump favors intervention into markets to achieve desired outcomes for the dollar and for interest rates he wants to maintain the us dollar as the world reserve currency but he also favors a weak dollar to help us exporters which is potentially inconsistent he favors low bond yields and he always has as a real estate guy and he wants the ability to influence the federal reserve and as you know just these interventions are very you know they they involve costly distortions and and uncertainties amid all this you know the the the us has changed its tone the just the tone and perception of the us and its its role in the globe has changed so the us is cutting subsidies for european defense it's cut soft dollar subsidies to lbcs trump has been and his vice president been nothing but belligerent allies and has has suggested banking out of of global trade agreements so this is the this kind of new world order i hate to use a term like that but that's what he's proposing and and as mike said new alliances would form away from the us and and they would isolate the us like the nineteen thirties so you've all been reading about this day in day out but it does it does pose tests for the for the economy the us and global economies and global trade markets and and importantly the fed's credibility and reliability so we think about markets and you know the the correction in the stock market markets have appropriately priced in expectations of recession and lower profits so markets have you know if you cut through the day to day volatility and the risk on risk off days the market is is pricing in you know a hit to the economy and the profits so if you this is a moving target but if you take where we are right now and don't hold me to this but i come up with if fully enforced about $820,000,000,000 in tariffs then that's based on a 45% on china minus the variance on on the iphones 10% globally 25% on steel and aluminum the vast majority of which comes from canada and and mexico and then 25% on autos but not auto parts so far so if you take that if they collect all the revenues on that and by the way you might be interested the customs bureau only accepts checks you can't wire your money to them up to about 2.8% true yes you're a lot of bribery

**John Cochrane:** white white

**Nichael D. Bordo:** no a lot of bribery

**Mickey Levy:** michael i do know somebody who's had some funds coming back and the check got lost in the mail so it seems like the and valerie this is this is your field but it seems like the i i would think the impacts of the tariffs on the real economy would have a larger negative fiscal multiplier than a tax on the same amount reflecting not just the higher uncertainties but the the the supply chain disruptions if you just think about you know canada mexico us businesses have been setting up supply chains and building them out for the last thirty years and then retaliation so you know i'd put a however low you think fiscal policy multipliers are i'd put a higher multiple multiple on the on on these and then of course trump's erratic behavior and policy making this has created a huge amount of uncertainty that that steve's going to talk about and and we have to remember this has a very large impact on small and private businesses that may not have capital to to to back themselves up the the left hand table on if you just look at the right column it shows where we were as of april 9 and this is out of the federal reserve bank of richmond a study that shows effective tariff rates by country of origin so so china a hundred and thirty five sticks out like a sore thumb but the the the tariffs assessed on imports from everywhere are far far higher than they were say in 2024 which is the second second column and then of course on the right is is steve's economic policy uncertainty index that's gone through the roof now i'm gonna switch over to the federal reserve and so if you think about this this is the tariffs are on a absolute collision course with the fed's dual mandate we should expect these tariffs to have negative impact and the uncertainty related with them hits to consumption and investment this is this the the uncertainty is is a decided negative for for business investment i might note in trump's first term and when we look at the imposition of the tariffs they had their largest negative impact on imports of capital goods related to to investment and so so then in addition to hitting the economy they should raise the general price level they should not add to persistent inflation unless inflationary expectations rise and be and those higher expectations become embedded so if you if you so this makes adding to the difficulty of the fed if you think about the the tariffs lower expected rates of return real return on on capital and should lower some natural rate of short run natural rate of interest which which makes the current fed funds rate higher and so so mike and i had a piece in the in the wall street journal recently basically arguing so if you if you think about it these tariffs and the uncertainty should involve an inward shift in aggregate supply and an inward shift in aggregate demand and the fed which is is in the business of managing aggregate demand shouldn't be responding to policy induced negative shocks and it should resist pressure including pressures from the president to do so but let's let's think of of of reality it's it's most likely the fed will respond and if you look historically the fed has responded much more quickly and aggressively to to weakness in labor markets than it has to higher inflation so you know our thought is if the impact of the tariffs is is hits the economy and you have modest increases in in the inflation but inflationary expectations remain well anchored then the fed's gonna respond pretty aggressively to higher unemployment and i might note if you look at for example at at not market based surveys of inflation expectations but that no if you if you look at market based surveys rather than consumer based surveys like the the the five year five year forwards have actually moved down a touch so inflationary expectations look look like they're in

**John Cochrane:** pretty good shape just expand on one small point we agree it's not a good idea to respond to a supply shock with increasing demand you said well but just the uncertainty demand shock but does it do any good to lower interest rates to offset an uncertainty demand shock is anyone gonna invest in the us no matter what the low low interest rate is steve might have an opinion on this too

**Steven Davis:** well the basic option data waiting story says you're less responsive to shocks including interest rate changes in a period of high uncertainty because the inaction ban widens so that's one of the leading theories for why uncertainty matters it's not the only one but it's probably part of the story it basically says stimulated fiscal policies are probably less responsive on the margin because of the high uncertainty

**John Cochrane:** that's a a reason why lower interest rates would not offset uncertainty that's excellent thank you

**Steven Davis:** at least the reason why to recognize it'll have less impact

**Mickey Levy:** let me just let me just add this point that you know the uncertainties and the tariffs you know lower expected rates of return which should lower you know interest rate not the natural real rate so so that makes the current funds rate higher than it would be otherwise now so now let's get to this issue of you know credit credibility and fiscal burdens and i and john i just hope that you don't end out saying see i told you so

**John Cochrane:** but i think there's a lot of that going on in the room but go ahead but

**Mickey Levy:** so if you think about the the combination of a loss in us government credibility and reliability and the rising us debt burdens it's really a a toxic mix and so so there is this concern and you've seen the the the decline in the dollar that that this loss of credibility could re could jeopardize the us treasuries as this global safe haven and put us debt in the current account at risk and so once again if you think globally you know the the loss of credibility reduces risk adjusted expected rates of return on dollar denominated assets say relative to euro or yen denominated assets and that has resulted in in a in a falling dollar so the dollar has fallen so we can ask the question that nobody knows the answer to how much does the dollar need to fall in order for global portfolio managers to want to reduce their exposure to dollar denominated assets and then you have to add the credibility issue and so right now foreigners own about a third of all outstanding publicly held debt if you look at us treasury yields adjusted for inflationary expectations they're still higher than other leading foreign debt however you know we have seen recently spikes in in treasury yields and what i really am alarmed about are are the some of the daily movements like when you have a a risk on where the stock market goes up bond yields go down and and the the dollar is moving up but then when you have risk off days you have the stock market falling bond yields going up and the dollar falling and that's alarming and so this you know the us exorbitant privilege could go in reverse and as ben franklin said it takes a long time to build reputation credibility but you can destroy it pretty quickly and then there's the fed and the fed is aware of these issues it's extremely concerned it's working behind the scenes looking into alternatives for adjusting regulations that would allow us commercial banks to own more treasuries to own more treasuries they don't have to hold capital against it but they do have liquidity requirements and the last thing we want is is for the fed to have to be forced into action to stabilize things this this left hand chart the blue line is this is the interest interest yield spread between us ten year treasuries and and ten year german bonds and then the right hand side shows the the euro dollar exchange rate and you see this huge divergence and this is it's telling us something and then but the but but the right hand side you've seen well ex anti real treasury yields have gone up they've they remained in a range and we have to follow those closely so i tried to develop a scenario analysis and this is nikki

**John Cochrane:** i i wanna preserve time for for everybody else to have a chance okay so take take a minute one minute but no okay

**Mickey Levy:** one minute scenario one best outcome everybody negotiates tariffs send out 10% we still end out with a mild recession i put a 15% probability on that highest probability is the less worst case currently tariffs stay about 25% moderate retaliation ongoing uncertainties you do gather recession and you do hit potential growth by maybe a quarter of a percent risk case scenario three was current tariffs plus loss of credibility and reputation lead to a treasury debt crisis with sizable stock declines us isolation and a much bigger hit us potential and then my worst worst scenario four is scenario three but with escalating trade war with us add to that the deportation of of millions of immigrants cuts in funding and pressure on the fed and so you put your own scenarios on this it's it's it's all a moving target and why would i put the highest probability on on the second least worst case simply two things and i say this hesitantly number one as we've seen in the last couple weeks trump responds to pain thresholds and backs off and number two congress eventually wakes up and pressures trump

**Steven Davis:** quick question you see the world moving away from the dollar in trade what if what do you see it moving into

**John Cochrane:** i i can ask that quickly you don't need to own a lot of dollars even to transact in dollars so holding of dollars is very different from transacting in dollars you transact in dollars you don't hold

**Andrew Grotto:** it's in your wallet you don't hold a lot of dollars

**John Cochrane:** but i i wanna move on to we're eating into steve's time which is unfair so steve who is an expert on policy uncertainty you must feel happy for your research if i'm happy for the country that's exactly right so

**Steven Davis:** so thanks for organizing this it couldn't be more timely i'm going to speak in a different register than is customary in an economics workshop and i'm gonna hold any questions until after my prepared remarks so we are living through an astoundingly destructive period in us trade policy jumble headed thinking and reckless decision making are harming the economy damaging us relations with allies and trading partners and destroying the already tattered trading order that supported prosperity and security for eighty years uncertainties around us trade policy are at unprecedented levels here's a newspaper based index of trade policy uncertainty that my coauthors and i constructed more than a decade ago you can see that there's happened just in the last two months it is unlike anything that we've seen in recent decades and and probably anything back to at least as far as the smooth hawley tariff this is also spilling over to other countries these are analogous newspaper based indexes constructed by ourselves and others for three major us trading partners again record levels the extraordinary nature of the trade policy rupture is also apparent to the stock market and other financial markets i'll give you one example that's just striking and vivid if you look all the way back to 1900 through 2023 and you systematically assess next pay next day newspaper accounts of what drives large daily jumps in the us stock market and large here means the stock market moves up or down by at least two and a half percent in a single day there are exactly 10 such jumps out of roughly 1,200 that next day newspaper accounts attribute to trade in the short period from march 26 was the first new trump tariffs and seventeen april trade policy news has triggered four or three depending on exactly how you count daily stock market jumps greater than this threshold so we've had a roughly 800 fold increase in the frequency of trade policy shocks that drive major stock price gyrations so there's been quite a bit of action since i put these slides together even though it was about a week ago so you can also see this is just some of that action but again i need to update the chart given what's happened recently you can also see this in another in another way this is a newspaper based equity market volatility tracker for trade policy that my colleague and i constructed in another paper it's essentially a two part process you construct a newspaper based index that tracks the vix you can do that quite well in real time and then you parse the newspaper articles that feed into that tracker index and if you look at things from that perspective as well the extent to which stock market volatility is accounted for by trade policy developments has reached record highs the overall us economic policy uncertainty index you saw a version of that earlier this is a weekly version here so it's updated through mid april and we are now at levels that exceed anything that we saw during the financial crisis or during the pandemic okay this is the overall us economic policy uncertainty index not just trade policy so unlike these previous peaks in policy uncertainty this one is almost entirely the consequence of ill advised policy decisions no financial crisis pandemic or war drove us to the present moment we did it to ourselves now this tremendous uncertainty around tariff rates is making consumers anxious and fearful that will lead to cutbacks in discretionary consumer spending it will also cause businesses to cut or defer investment spending as they wait for clarity about tariffs you can't make sound decisions about what to produce how to source inputs or where to invest when tariffs are subject to drastic changes at the president's whim so you wait this wait and see behavior by household which we chatted about briefly earlier means less demand for labor over time and fewer job opportunities for american workers historically based on my research and research by many others industrial production tends to start falling in a serious way about three to four months after upward policy and certainty shocks with peak responses at about six to eight months employment effects settle in more slowly with peak effects occurring after about ten to fourteen months thus far the hard data show little evidence of the slowdown in us economic activity but remember it's really only been three or four weeks since something hit the fan in a big way new claims for unemployment insurance benefits have yet to rise that's a that's a commonly used early indicator but here's here's another newer measure which does give some reason to concern this is a a measure there are multiple out there of us job openings it's available at a daily frequency and you can see that there's been a roughly 5% decline in new job openings in the united states by this measure just in the last few weeks now let me talk about another negative effect that doesn't get a lot of attention now and i'm talking about the negative effects of the tariff policy uncertainty now and for the foreseeable future the chief priorities of many business executives are a to grapple with the uncertainties around trade policy and b to lobby the trump administration for tariff breaks that diverts attention and energy from serving customers developing products training workers and improving operations it creates incentives for businesses to focus on rent seeking rather than socially productive business activities if you find it hard to grasp this point ask yourself the following question are we better off when apple's ceo tim cook nvidia's jensen huang and microsoft's satya sodala focus on a or b instead of how to improve iphones computer chips and software obviously not so just multiply that that question to thousands or 10 tens of thousands of other business leaders and their staff and you'll see why this need to grapple with uncertainty and this increased incentive to engage in rent seeking activity will be harmful and of course if you incentivize business leaders to succeed by a rent seeking that's what you will get so let me turn to the financial markets recent financial market and briefly we've heard of some about that already in the period from april 4 '2 days after liberation day to april 11 the yield on ten year constant maturity us treasury securities both the inflation adjusted version and the the nominal version rose by close to 50 basis points and the dollar fell by about one and a half percent on a trade weight weighted basis both developments are extremely unusual occurrences in a period when the us stock market is falling and there's a spike in uncertainty as you remember when you think back to the pandemic experience or the financial crisis financial crisis did to a considerable extent originate in the united states but nonetheless there was a huge rush to buy safe liquid us treasure securities driving down their yields and driving up the exchange rate value of the dollar the opposite has happened in this in this period that's extremely worrisome it's extremely unusual and as mickey has already discussed it suggests they hear to fore rare rare doubts about the safe haven status of us treasuries and a loss of confidence in the us capacity for sensible policymaking why is this important it's obvious in some respects but let me spell out some of the details first higher treasury bond yields mean higher borrowing costs for businesses and households because treasury yields are benchmarked for interest rates throughout the economy that will deter long term business investments and that it'll make it harder to and more costly to obtain mortgages banks could be less willing to extend mortgages so that will be the dampest investment dampened investment hiring residential construction and consumer spending that is affected by borrowing costs second it means higher debt servicing costs for taxpayers again mickey has already made that point let me just run you through a little bit of arithmetic us government debt held by the public is roughly 1.2 times annual gdp currently so a 50 basis point rise in treasury yields across the maturities spectrum sustained rise raises the us government's debt servicing cost by a hundred and $80,000,000,000 that's 0.6% of gdp that's more than doge has claimed to saved so far just to put that in another perspective and the trump administration like the biden administration before it displays no serious intention to address the honest unsustainable us fiscal trajectory so the negative fiscal policy act policy actions that undermine confidence in the united states its economy and its government will intensify over time you recent us tariff policy is also helping drive a tremendous loss of goodwill in the rest of the world and so here is a picture that captures that it comes from a morning consult which interviews thousands of people every day around the world about a whole variety of things including recently how they view the united states and there's just been an extraordinary loss in how favorably average people in the rest of the world view view the united states and you might not be surprised one of the beneficiaries of that tremendous loss of goodwill in the united states appears to be our chief geopolitical adversary in the interest of time i skipped the charge for mexico and china but the loss of goodwill towards the united states and mexico and especially china is actually much deeper in those countries so again we are kicking allies and friends trading partners in the face and not surprisingly they they don't like that so my foregoing i wanna it's it's to be obvious to the economist in the room that my foregoing remarks give very little attention to the standard economic arguments against tariffs and in favor of free trade so i'll just hit the bullet points comparative advantage specialization variety benefits scale economies competition idea diffusion those arguments are well understood among economists and for the most part uncontroversial among economists i don't review them here in the in just for the sake of time because i wanna focus on these more unusual aspects of the present moment but i do wanna note that even if we get past all of the uncertainty and craziness of the moment and eventually settle at a new equilibrium with much higher tariff rates than in recent decades it will harm america and other countries beyond the negative effects of the present disruption okay so let me close by quoting doug irwin with a nice article in a recent issue of the economist magazine he says look terms the trump's this is right right around the time of the liberation day speech trump's tariffs blow an enormous hole in the liberal order that america has led and fostered since the second world war you've already heard that from me and and from michael they undermine every free this is what i wanna stress they undermine every free trade agreement america has ever signed including the one trump signed with canada and mexico the usmca in his first term so the key thing here is that at this point certainly as long as trump is president and maybe beyond no one can sign a trade deal with the united states with any confidence that they will be that that it will have much durability and much reliability so all of this talk about how there's some brilliant negotiation strategy here going on some genius at work is of course who we so in addition to its economic harm trumpian trade policy has brought a huge loss of trust in the reliability of the us government and it will take many years much work and internal us reforms i think to repair the damage thanks okay just to

**John Cochrane:** add to your point these are undertaken under a declaration of national emergency what are we doing

**Steven Davis:** with that let's

**John Cochrane:** pass on to steven redding

**Mickey Levy:** i wanna preserve everybody's rights

**John Cochrane:** their fifteen minutes of glory

**Stephen J. Redding:** thank you

**Stephen J. Redding:** thank you very much john thank you steve so thanks so much for organizing this panel and the opportunity to speak today so i wanted to speak a little bit on a kind of conceptual point related to some of the closing points that steve made but i think it's sort of sometimes lost in the tariff in the tariff really emphasize a sort of single point i'm gonna spend most of my time on it so what is that single point well i wanna start with with an image of babe ruth what does babe ruth have to do with trade and tariffs well even as a brit i know that babe ruth was sort of famous for for being a slugging outfielder for the new york yankees perhaps less well known he began his career as a pitcher for the boston red sox and so why well he was exceptional at both those activities but he had finite time and resources so what did he decide to do he decided to specialize on what he was relatively best at where he was truly exceptional namely as a slugging outfielder and leave the pitching to somebody else even if an absolute chance he was a better pitcher for the team as a whole it was better for him to focus on being a slugging outfielder and we're all aware of that in our everyday lives we don't try to grow our own food make our own clothes tend our own sheep and cattle and chickens you know we're all academics we we specialize in what what what we think we have market demand for we earn a salary for our universities and then we spend that salary in the market we specialize in what we think we're relatively good at and we get other things through the market well of course the sort of key conceptual point i want to make is the markets don't stop at borders and that these same arguments are equally valid for countries countries have finite resources they can use those resources in different ways what does trade allow them to do it allows countries to specialize in what they're relatively good at and get the other good on international markets and so i'm going to illustrate that with a sort of figure from introductory microeconomics that you'd encounter in an economics class and so i know there are sort of several non economists in the room and so please forgive me i know this is a little bit inside baseball but i wanna use this figure to try to make a talk make a kind of key conceptual point and i'll try to draw draw it out so so what does this figure show well it shows sort of a conceptual world where we're gonna think of there being two goods cloth and wine and our country can produce either of those two goods and the curved line that touches the two axes is summarizes the economy's production possibilities it can only produce a certain amount of cloth even if it uses all its resources in cloth just because it has finite resources and it can only produce a certain amount of wine if it uses all of its resources in wine again because it has finite resources and this curve is downward sloping why because if i produce more wine i move my resources into wine i have to take them away from cloth and that means i can produce less cloth and so that curve shaped line is the economy's production possibilities and if we didn't have international trade we'd have to consume somewhere on that curved line and if markets are competitive and firms maximize profits which point will we end up on we will actually end up on point d where the straight line which is the relative price of the two goods is a tangent to this curved line summarizing the economy's production possibilities figure also shows consumers preferences they're the u shaped curves and each u shaped curve is all combinations of our two goods cloth and wine that yield a a given level of satisfaction to consumers and again they're downward sloping if i give you more cloth i have to take some wine away from you to keep your profit utility constant and so consumers would like to be on the highest u shaped curve possible because u shaped curves that are higher up involve more of both goods and hence more more utility and and if we're in our closed economy and consumers maximize their profits again we'll be at a a tangency point where the price line just touches one of these u shaped curves and so point d is our closed economy outcome both consumers and producers are in equilibrium and what do we see at point d well for each good one and two you're consuming exactly what you produce and that makes sense if you're closed you you have to consume what you you have to produce what you consume yourself and so what's the big insight here well what does trade do well if two countries trade and they're slightly different from one another they're not exactly the same as one another well they're gonna have different relative prices and so when one of our economies opens up to trade relative prices are gonna change and what's the sort of fundamental insight here well when relative prices change firms can specialize at producing more of the good whose relative price has gone up and the country can specialize in in producing what it's relatively good at consumers can now substitute towards the good that's become relatively cheaper on world markets and so consumers can also respond to that change in relative prices and increase their utility and so the steepest red line is a sort of new set of relative prices once our economies open up to trade and you'll see firms are again at the tangency point at c so firms are maximizing their profits consumers are again at the tangency point at a consumers are maximizing their utility so both those agents are in equilibrium but what do you see well a is not equal to c they're not at the same point anymore why not well trade allows you to separate what you consume from what you produce and this is the really big conceptual point that i wanted to make which is that you know i think we all would want any administration or whatever political you know texture to to deliver in terms of maximizing the the welfare of of of americans but but this sort of basic economic analysis just sort of highlights that there's a fundamentally wrong view of the world being put forward here that the trump administration makes this argument that america is being screwed in international markets it's being taken advantage of by by other countries and that's fundamentally a zero sum argument that china is getting a bigger share of the pie the us is getting a smaller share of the pie whereas whereas what this figure shows or what this analysis shows is actually trade is a mutually beneficial process that both countries can gain from opening up to world markets all you need is for relative prices to be different in the open economy to the closed economy and you're guaranteed to gain from trade doesn't matter whether the price line gets deeper whether it gets flatter the analysis go goes through doesn't even matter if china is more productive than the us it's everything all you need is for relative prices to be different the us can still gain from trade and so the really deep point that i wanted to draw to draw out is that trade is just like technology the trade is an alternative trade is an alternative technology to getting what you want to consume you can either produce it yourself use your own production technology or you can specialize in what you're good at sell it on low markets and get the other good in return and that's the really deep point here why does that help us understand tariffs what's a tariff it's a tax on trade so tariff is essentially a tax on technology we wouldn't typically think we should tax computers or artificial intelligence because we think this new technology makes us more productive we want to use it we want to benefit from our productivity growth well it's exactly the same for international trade we're taxing a technology here and that's all that's going on and that's the kind of really sort of deep conceptual point i i wanted to make here of course there can sometimes be reasons for taxing technologies such as artificial intelligence because they have income distributional effects but it's because of those income distributional consequences and we're foregoing these aggregate gains so i've only got a couple of minutes left i i'll just make a cup couple of other points here when could one say well even though i agree with that there can be arguments for tariffs i might want to go away from that standard analysis but one argument you can make is well we tax lots of things and tax it as a distortion why don't we have a little bit of taxes on trade it should be part of the ramsey scheme of optimal taxation and that's potentially a valid point but but tariffs have two characteristics that make them undesirable things to tax what are they well when you impose a tariff you actually distort two things consumers choices and producers choices the tariffs are particularly distortionary because they they tax both firms and consumers in a way that a a consumption tax would only be targeted on consumers a production subsidy or production tax would only affect producers that's one reason tariffs are are kind of generally not that desirable what's another reason well the tax base is much smaller the us trades about 15 imports about 15% of us gdp and we know that the distortion of a tax is is you know rises quadratically in the magnitude of the tax so if the tax base is smaller then to raise a given amount of revenue you need a bigger tax and so taxes on trade tend to be distortionary relative to taxes on say expenditure which covers the whole whole of gdp the other argument you can make for sometimes introducing a tariff is for a for a country that's large such as united states it can use its monopoly power to tax imports reduce the quantity of imports and push the price down on more markets and again that's a potentially valid argument for tariffs but its big problem is retaliation and so you can if foreign country should retaliate as we've seen they've done you can end up with no change in world prices all you've done is tax trade and and have lower amounts of trade and and to reduce welfare and then the final point of course you can make is an argument based on industrial policy and national security and i think my colleague to my right is gonna talk about more about that in a moment so i'm gonna pass that that onto him a little bit but one of the feature of the trump administration tariffs is they're not particularly targeted towards national security industrial policy these are broad based tariffs on all goods it's pretty hard to justify that and you know what's and that what do t shirts have to do with national security it's it's pretty hard to make that argument i'm pretty much out of time i'll i'll just sort of flag that myself and other economists have studied the tariffs for the first trump administration and we find by and large that what you see happening in the data is exactly what standard trade theory would tell you would happen this graph is a sort of events study star graph the vertical line is when the tariffs of the first trump administration were introduced and you see that import prices in the us rise by roughly the size of the tariff most of the tariff has actually passed through into domestic prices very little improvement in the terms of trade pass through to consumer prices is only about 30 3% about a third but most of it most of the price increase passes through to wholesalers retailers other us agents and the counterpart of that is you see big changes in import value which is again what standard economic theory would suggest so i'm pretty much out of time and i i want to make sure i you know leave time to my my colleague to my right the only other point i'll make is that michael compared these recent tariffs to the holy tariffs in the nineteen thirties there's sort of two reasons why these tariffs are a bigger deal now firstly they're bigger in magnitude and the increases from a lower level that's one reason the other reason is that the us is much open now than it was in the nineteen thirties trade has a bigger share of us gdp and then finally in the nineteen thirties we tended to trade final goods whereas now we trade intermediate inputs in global value chains and these figures here are taken from a paper of another author who studied the tariffs of the first trump administration they actually found that they lowered manufacturing employment rather than increasing it why because the tariffs raise the cost of inputs for us manufacturers and that's a kind of very important feature of the world that's different now to in the past so let me stop there the kind of key point i wanted to make is that traders like a technology tariffs are a tax on trade while one can sometimes think of reasons to do that generally you're foregoing the benefit of of this new technology and lowering aggregate welfare and i should stop there thank you very much

**Mickey Levy:** great i wanna move on to andrew before i do

**John Cochrane:** why is he here in addition to being a great colleague of ours he's an author coauthor with hr mcmaster a very interesting hoover report on economic statecraft written before the tariffs went in and i think but if anyone's gonna say something nice at all about tariffs i wonder

**John Cochrane:** but i don't

**John Cochrane:** know if that's what you're

**John Cochrane:** gonna do but well

**John Cochrane:** go for it

**Mickey Levy:** so four

**Andrew Grotto:** economists and a lawyer walking to a bar i'm i'm reminded of that you know the old star trek where you know kirk and spock and mccoy would land in a planet along with some fourth random guy who knew who was gonna get it i'm at this point john so i'm i'm i'm not here to defend trump's tariffs or even even tariffs in in general i i do have a slideshow and and wait wait a minute for the the team to put it up what while they do i wanna leave you with two two main points the first is that tariffs are are now a coercive instrument

**Steven Davis:** of state grid

**Andrew Grotto:** in in the past as our our previous panelists laid out tariff policy was usually driven by economic parochial economic domestic economic interests and trump has has recast them as an instrument of of statecraft and more akin to sanctions so there's this this shift from tariffs as a protective measure to a coercive measure that's a pretty big deal there are a ton of examples in history where we've seen the tariff used in this way and and so for example one of one of the in in the first round of tariffs that was against china one of the rationalizations was china wasn't doing enough campaign at all right not not an economic objective right a policy a geopolitical objective why why has trump recast tariffs in this way i wanna offer you four possibilities i think all of them are true but i'll present them as a hypothesis i think the first is that you're oh great yeah awesome so i think there's at least four reasons why trump seems to be so drawn to tariffs one is they can be done and undone unilaterally so they put the executive in a position of commanding authority tariffs have the the the the the political the signaling virtue of being loud and clear as far as policy and streams go for the targets of tariffs it's it's relatively straightforward to understand how a 10% fifteen % twenty % tariff might affect your your your your business

**John Cochrane:** the

**Andrew Grotto:** third reason is is that tariffs mobilize rent seeking and i think for trump this is a feature not a bug because it means that corporate executives to to my colleague's earlier point to steve's earlier point have to go to trump and and seek relief which is a source of political power for the executive right and and last but not least is that the retaliation that comes from tariffs right the the the actions that allies and and adversaries alike have taken in response to trump's tariffs they're all done by foreigners right so there's a there's a way in which you know trump can potentially defend the tariffs as not his fault but china's fault canada's fault mexico's fault the europeans' fault and so i think that's why he seems to be so so drawn to this particular policy instrument let me go to the next two two slides or two yet right so in other words the the goals for tariffs may be mixed their economic and political reasons but there's also potentially geopolitical reasons whether that's fentanyl is one example let's go on to the next next slide and i think the result is that critiques rooted in in in arguments about the negative economic impact obviously important and worth raising but compared to past the recent past you know past few decades they're gonna prove less decisive or persuasive which which is is is is creates a challenge for for those of us who think that this whole tariff business is is fundamentally misguided let's go on to the next slide so let me i wanna spend just a moment talking about about china next slide please so i was struck a few weeks ago when that that that latest round of tariffs was was announced the white house folks comms team made a big point of saying this is not a negotiation we're not doing the tariffs because we wanna negotiate now over the last couple hours we've seen some signs coming out that maybe that's not the case that was what they said two weeks ago which you know begs begs the question okay what what is the goal right we we've we've we've heard from our our economist colleagues that the economic case for tariffs is weak which puts a heavy burden on the geopolitical case let's let's go to the next next bullet and so so to what geopolitical lens right you know is it to recast the global trading order in in us interest it's not obvious how the tariffs could possibly do that because all they're doing is uniting us trading partners against us next slide please could they be used to to to recast alliances right so part part of the critique of of of europe has been that that us subsidizes european defense that that's that's that's the argument that that the trump has made repeatedly and you know tariffs are i think a way in his mind to begin to make the europeans pay right so again it's a goal to recast elections it's not obvious how that's gonna happen because we have obviously a bunch of other shared economic and security interests with the europeans many of those interests cannot be achieved solely through military or diplomatic power they require economic power a great example of this whether you're in favor of export controls or not the europeans particularly the dutch have been a big ally of the us in export controls and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to china and i'll note for you that in on april 1 the dutch government was due to put put out an updated set of controls those controls have not been put out yet why i think that that the dutch decided to wrap that into this broader debate on tariffs could the goal be to isolate the couple from china well that that that's i think wishful thinking if anything we are pushing our allies to ally with china at least economically when it comes to these these tariffs so the bottom line for me is we've we've heard the economic case against them the geopolitical case is every bit as weak i i i just don't see it that's not to say that there isn't necessarily a role for tariffs or any coercive instrument of economic state correct in us grand strategy it just means that that that those instruments need to be part of a grand strategy which is clearly missing and i'll conclude with just a next slide please this is the report that hr and i put out last month several of you were involved in providing us really valuable feedback on it thank you for those who did and our argument is that trump administration needs to have an integrated strategy for how these different pieces of the economic statecraft toolkit whether it's tariffs sanctions development cooperation industrial policy fit together as part of a broad grand strategy for pursuing us economic political and geopolitical objectives

**John Cochrane:** and i'll stop there so potentially useful but in this case singularly counterproductive for their ends we have till 01:20 so i'd like to invite questions and maybe let's let's have a bunch of questions first rather than so that everyone gets a chance to talk and you don't even have to have a question mark at the end of the question so yes i will start here and and get our answer

**Speaker 3:** well i just wanted to offer some additional factual information none of you discussed what's going on with our friends with whom we're trying to negotiate trade agreements in which the lead examples that are given are britain and japan so i can give you an update on what's going on with britain and japan as of yesterday i had good conversations with relevant officials in washington on yesterday and because it's revealing japanese case the japanese have been told their economic minister met with trump the atmospherics were wonderful the substance was zero they've been told that of course the japanese are greatly concerned about the sectoral tariffs on steel and autos that they've been told those sectoral tariffs are nonnegotiable and then but they're interested in having a conversation about 24% reciprocal tariffs and then the but the americans are having trouble even presenting position as to what they want from the japanese in exchange to relax get relaxation of the reciprocal tariffs and i won't even comment on the bureaucratic chaos they're encountering and trying to figure out who to talk to about what the british case is more interesting still because the british worked very hard and the vice president is supposed to be actually personally chairing a task force to try to get something done on this what the british have encountered is that again sectoral tariffs are nonnegotiable and nobody goes below 10 and since the british are at 10% there's really nothing there's nothing left to discuss so the the british are actually prepared to you know pay various things and had come up with a whole list of things that basically paying the americans for some sort of relief and but now they're kind of realizing that there's not there's simply nothing there and the americans of course would like some sort of trade agreement with the british that they could announce just to show that they're doing some deals with someone the british having come to the conclusions i've just described decided you know what we don't need to be in a super hurry and so this morning in washington rachel reeves who's in washington kind of made clear that britain is in no particular hurry to sign this deal and is you know not gonna kind of waive all of its health regulations and and so forth to to rush into something yesterday also like one of my contacts talked to a very senior trump economic official who this senior economic official was speculating aloud gee maybe we just ought to create a whole new wto my contact had been a trade negotiator and commented that that would be a fairly challenging negotiation and might take some time the intro the trump administration official said maybe this new wto could be based on the oecd which is an which is an intriguing thought because the ideas you know these would be the free the free economies you know the basis of the oecd and maybe you just have a rebooted wto but that only included the oecd countries and so forth but i i mentioned this because it also touches a little bit on andrew's commentary because you can see in the context with britain and japan for example how can they ask them to do stuff on china in in an in that negotiating context everybody

**John Cochrane:** yeah got till 01:20 i've got mike ala ken and sebastian edwards keep your eyes on the clock

**Speaker 8:** i'm gonna speak very rapidly about a a few points first of all john taylor and i have been involved in negotiating trade agreements and if you think that a trade agreement if someone comes down to the mountain with some tablets and says the good news is i've got them down to 10 that isn't exactly how they happen they're they're long involved you have to define every product everything etcetera there's lobbying on definitions around the edges etcetera and many of these will have to be approved by parliament so it's this isn't gonna if they come up with a framework that would be remarkable that would be but that's all they'll be able to do i agree with virtually everything that's been said even more strongly and for some of them it might say less for others i think to steve redding's point remember openness is at the margins so so the average is understating the openness of the us economy we we buy or sell more oil or soybeans at the margin even though we have net we produce we are and if you look at the current account right now remember in the last dozen years fracking and the immense increase in oil production in the united states has decreased our net import oil import bill by 400,000,000,000 a year okay so just get an idea that there's been something that it would be even larger still i wanna just reinforce the point about whether the existing system economic and geopolitical system that the the post war secure post war two security and economic comments was really sustainable given a lot that's happened so i think something was gonna change now i don't like what trump's done i think he's been a blunderbuss i think he has this exaggerated notion that if he can negotiate everything bilaterally his power be maximized i think he also thinks if he produces some uncertainty in game theory terms it gives a little bargaining advantage etcetera but i i think that's really dangerous when i talk about repeated interactions with our allies and especially non aligned nations who have have to make some judgments not just economic but geopolitical and military i wanna emphasize the importance if this stays around in some even some watered down form that understanding value added trade accounts will be very important there's been some progress on that they're far from perfect the last ten years or so there's been some progress on that and i know mike mark melitz has an interesting arlington model where he talks about the subdivision and trade across parts and how you can get just immense gains from trade in that regard and i think that's what you were getting at to some extent steve but here's some of the things that are worth thinking about in sustainability okay number one we've had these big expansion of global trade rounds trade tariff reductions in various rounds but combined with technology particular sectors of our economies particularly in advanced industrial countries including blue collar workers in old industries take the most extreme case have been hit very very hard so our theory that tells us we we win win from trade doesn't talk about the division of the spoils including the losses and probably we've done a poor even though we have some trade adjustments poor job of understanding when they get concentrated so much repeatedly and when they're even made vastly worse by technology the typical job in a factory now is operating complex electronic equipment it's not a bunch of bulky eyes hauling crates around and then illegal immigration and the vast expansion of welfare states since world war two especially in the last thirty years in europe and the need to reorder the defense priorities from a massive disinvestment in the american military we've been spending a hundred billion dollars a year less in inflation adjusted terms on our military than a dozen years ago before we started worrying about russia and china and maybe so much about iran so all that's kind of a jumble of all this to which my conclusion is well i agree with everything that's been said and i i have a lot of a program for what's being done and i think that both the first and second moments are very risky are very dangerous as steve steve davis emphasized and i think that we're we we wouldn't have seen nothing happen that wasn't that isn't the proper baseline to think about geopolitically in the context in which these policies are gonna form gonna be formed so the political pressure is

**John Cochrane:** paola then ken and sebastian edwards online and you're down to a minute and thirty seconds

**Speaker 9:** yeah so i have a really quick question which was not touched maybe vaguely by steve i mean it seems that you all agree the only person that is not here is a political scientist and the question is i mean this it seems that you can none of you can none of us can rationalize what happened i'm actually i keep on going on and on and says what about the adviser there are some people that we know and they seem more reasonable and clearly nothing so the question is rules because you know if you want to calm the uncertainty the only thing you could do is basically put a clause in front of trump because you know in on on trump's mouth you you think about what he did with the fed something like that like you know if you did if you think what he did with the fed was pretty much like you know i'm gonna remove powell then i'm not gonna remove powell and so on so every day is a different one so to what extent congress has the ability to say you know this is not a role that the president can play so these tariffs should not be part and so we go away from the 10% or anything else and then maybe we go to zero action but zero action at this point is probably better than this action

**John Cochrane:** good good point

**Speaker 6:** first of all this is not the first time tariff was used as a coercive element in geopolitics 1941 oil tariffs against japan did result in retaliation and i don't think anybody criticized fdr for it afterward but anyway that's this has happened my my real question here is why would anybody make any deal with trump because this he he acted under this 1977 law that gave him emergency powers now it that was long before nafta apparently canada and mexico knew about this emergency thing and felt fine to negotiate nafta and then also the next one and there were many other inner agreements and everybody knew about this 1977 law but now but i think nobody ever thought we'd vote for this purpose but now given that trump has done that how can with that law in place anybody sign an agreement knowing that he's gonna could rip it up the next day

**John Cochrane:** sebastian

**Speaker 10:** oh thank you thank you john this has been very interesting and i was glad to hear michael boruto talk about raul prebisch i i think that until maybe a month ago any economist when he or she heard the words tariffs and industrialization in the same sentence they thought about latin america and they failed import substitution industrialization so the us is becoming a latin american country finally

**Speaker 9:** yes it is

**Speaker 10:** let me let me and there's a long literature and lots of people including ann krieger and jack deesh baguette and and others participated in the latin american perspective let me just point out to three concepts of that were very much present in the latin american debate that i think should play a bigger role in our conversation the first one is the tariff equivalents of non tariff barriers it's mentioned but i don't think that that there's been any effort on behalf of the administration to calculate those so if you look at the report by the us trade representative that came out a few weeks ago chile has one page because there are no tariffs it has a free trade agreement brazil has six pages and japan has 11 pages and most of the brazil and japan pages are non tariff barriers but in order to have the conversation what we try to do in latin america was find the tariff equivalent to of that that's number one the number two concept is the rates of effective protection i think that steve or someone put up or maybe mickey the the effective tariffs chart but effective it's different the the effective rates of protection it's a concept that was developed by harry johnson and and and ann krieger and so on and max gordon it take took into account the the rule tariffs on inputs and many many sectors ended up having negative rates of protection all exports so if you export boeing jets and x percent of the inputs are imported boeing jets are going to end up having a negative effective rate of protection it's a concept that has disappeared from the literature it had some problems but i think it's very illustrative and finally i think that maybe mickey mentioned it briefly but it's something that has been around in the latin american discussion capital controls was part of the conversation and we did not discuss maybe john you should have a new meet a meeting of stephen myron's idea of imposing controls on capital inflows into the us which was i i i just had i i gave a talk for argentina earlier this morning and that's one question that they are beginning to address finally capital con controls and info so maybe there's something three issues that come from latin america that maybe we should take into account in our conversations thank you

**John Cochrane:** there are so many bad ideas about the migration thank you everybody

**Speaker 10:** that that is true so you don't want to stay latin american you want to be not latin american

**John Cochrane:** chile wasn't bad for us thank

**Speaker 3:** you everybody
