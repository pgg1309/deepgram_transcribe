**Speaker 0:** tariffs went into effect the breadth and size of these tariffs particularly on china beg the question of whether we're gonna start to soon see the impact on prices paid by american consumers and to answer that i can't really think of anyone who's better positioned to talk to us about it than alberto cavallo i think most of the people on this call will know alberto's work as our academic partner and a cofounder of pricestats who capture inflation trends in close to real time using online prices from retailers all over the world and alberto of course is also a professor at harvard business school and a widely published author of a of a variety of papers related to price formation and inflation and he's been at the forefront of research on this topic of tariffs and their pass through to prices and price stats is a perfect tool for us to help capture those effects and i think we're gonna get some insights as to what he's been seeing in the daily data and i know he's gonna spend some time on a newly published paper and what i think is a groundbreaking piece of research focused on the trends that we're seeing in us goods prices just over the last few weeks as a final note the way we'll run this is that alberto will give his remarks we'll go to q and a with you the audience i might have a few questions as well but with that alberto welcome to you the floor is yours

**Speaker 1:** thank you tim and thank you everyone for joining the call so i will i i thought the best way to start was to also show you what is happening with some of the price stats indicators and then i'll go to some of my my latest research so let let me start with the for those of you who have access to our data you probably been seeing some of these charts this is the monthly inflation rate both in our index in in orange and in blue the cpi i wanna point out that next month's numbers or let's say april the ones that are gonna be published by the cpi may be a bit higher our data has actually increased to 0.3% which is somewhat higher than the 0.2% we had last month but overall the level of inflation is still sort of contained between that level between 0.2 zero point three on a monthly basis so there isn't in my mind too much to be particularly concerned when we look at the aggregate index so this is the the monthly rate you can also look at what happens for example with the trend of the price index something that i've been doing a lot since covid some of you may have seen me present work to try to detect the trend of the price level and you can see that this is the price index for the aggregate index for the us you can see that actually the trend in in in the us aggregate index has actually been quite stable i would say in the since december of of this year and and i'll also mention that this level of trend is actually lower than the one we saw at the beginning of of 2024 so from that perspective there's little right now to be worried looking at the aggregate data in fact if you look closely you'll notice the last couple of weeks we've actually seen some downward pressure coming from some sectors like fuel also there this has actually been pointed out by michael metcalfe from from the strategy team at states regalable markets i'm gonna use some of his charts because i think they're tremendously helpful to illustrate what price that's showing on the left you you actually can see the price that's indexed the price index itself within the range of historical values that we've been collecting the shaded areas the ten year interquartile range and then the red line is the median and you can see that it's roughly at those levels within those bounds in fact in march we were below the median then suddenly a bit in april above the median but overall these are normal levels now michael has pointed out because he wrote this on the april 17 that the first two weeks of april we were seeing some upward pressure in some sectors in particular he pointed out correctly that there were two one was transportation greatly affected by by by fuel in our case and also household equipments these these bars show you the levels in orange at that we are at with monthly readings for april versus the historical averages so clearly in household equipment we are on on extreme at the on the extreme upper bound and and fuel prices it's true that they've been growing in april but i wanna point that out this is actually the monthly rate again of our index and the cpi and you can see here in april an uptick in the in the in in the monthly rate but overall these levels that we're seeing are still much lower than what we saw

**Speaker 0:** in the last couple of years they're maybe higher than the ten year average but this is nothing like what we had seen in 2024 and even 2023 as well so i am not particularly concerned in fact

**Speaker 1:** i think the fuel sector is likely in the following weeks and potentially months if we end up seeing a recession it's going to be putting downward pressure on aggregate prices where we do see in the price sales data a more persistent change in trend that could be linked to tariff pass through is in particular on the subsector called household goods and furniture it does not have a particularly large weight in the cpi but it is connected strongly connected to core goods inflation and usually we can detect sometimes changes in core goods trends first in the sector before we see it in others so we pay a lot of attention to it and clearly household goods and furniture come from a lot of the of these goods come from china so there's a lot of clues that this may be due to the tariff pass through so i'm gonna show you some research that tries to shed some light on that there are actually two pieces of research that i i wanted to mention one is more historical an old paper i wrote and some of you may have seen me present these results in the past we wrote this in 2021 about the the what we were seeing in the data from the first trade trade war in 2018 and 2020 this paper is actually becoming relevant recently because the government the administration used this to to justify some of the numbers they came up with the calculation of the of the reciprocal tariff so i wanted to clarify what we actually found in that paper how that things may be different today and then i'll show you results from a new paper that i just put out a few days ago on on the april 20 showing what is happening in real time and how it connects to what we had done in the past so let me start with what we learned from the first trade war in that paper together with jenny tang gitalopinath and and brent neiman we basically compared prices at the border so the prices that importers were paying with retail prices for individual goods and we did this about one and a half years after the first tariffs were implemented it was a significant amount of time that had passed and we were basically asking who paid for the tariffs it could be foreign exporters it could be us firms where they're bringing the goods into the us or it could be the us consumers that end up seeing higher prices and we found that the majority of the burden was falling on us firms and this could be the retailers the importers but that there was essentially they were paying higher costs and they were not passing it on quickly to consumers that's the biggest takeaway of of the paper i'll walk you through some of the specific results because i think it illustrates how different factors can affect pass through okay so if we start with border prices like i said there was full import tariff pass through and we did not find evidence that the chinese exporters were reducing their prices despite the fact that the rmb was depreciated or the dollar was appreciating at the time we could have cushioned some of these border prices but the pass through from exchange rate is usually slow and low for the us given that goods are priced in dollars so we did not find much evidence for

**Speaker 0:** that

**Speaker 1:** and essentially the importers were bearing the full cost you can see this in this chart which shows the prices that they paid after accounting for the tariffs and roughly for a 20% average tariff rate they the importers were paying about 18% more so they were like i said bearing the cost now what was also interesting is that we looked at the retaliation tariffs and what u s exporters had to do and in their case again the u s was paying the cost for this because us exporters had to reduce their prices in response to these retaliations and we found aliens at that time that this was mostly because on the export side the us was sending a lot of undifferentiated agricultural products to china which china could bring from other locations like south america soybeans for example was one so that forced the us exporters to drop their prices if you think about imports it was actually very different we were bringing at the time into the us goods that were differentiated and there was a little chance at least in the short run to bring those goods from other places that were not china so that meant that chinese exporters had little pressure at the time to reduce their prices and the us ended up paying for all of that so the type of goods we bring obviously affects the the pass through rates you end up facing and how much you end up seeing being borne by the us the second result of the paper was more about retail price and here's where we found limited impact and there are things that i think are important to remember for this round of of tariffs if you think back of 2018 initially there were relatively few sectors affected and the size of the tariffs was relatively small so this is showing you annual inflation rates for those first goods that were affected the most obvious ones at the beginning were washing machines the tariff rates were actually about 20% and we did see relatively quick pass through and full pass through in that case i think the 20% number was quite quite important that suggests that the size of the tariff mattered a lot because later we saw handbags bicycles and other goods being affected by 10% tariffs and there was not much happening at the consumer level until in a second round those tariffs were raised to about 25% so the size matters clearly a lot and and obviously the the sizes we're talking about right now are even greater than than some of these so that could speed up some of the of the past due the second thing we did find at the time and i think it plays a role today as well a lot of these large retailers imported a lot of their goods themselves and we could monitor that at the at the border using customs data there was lots of evidence of front loading of inventories and stockpiling before the tariffs took place and there was evidence even at the time of of a significant trade diversion happening and later we learned there were a lot of exceptions given as well this this graph actually shows you in blue the amount of tons that were imported by by two very large retailers from china they import these goods directly themselves and you can see that after the announcements of investigations related to tariffs or even as the tariffs were being implemented we saw these spikes that then come down and this gives a buffer to the retailers to delay some of that price adjustment and the red line here is actually the amount of of goods that are the tons that were being brought from other locations and we saw those spike as the as the tariffs were being implemented and finally i would say overall we did find relatively little evidence of pass through or evidence of little pass through even one point five years after it which suggested there was a reduction in margins playing a big role at the time and and and and this was delaying this process so the obvious question is based on what we saw then what may happen now there's there's some arguments to be made that the pass through into consumer prices could be higher this time and i'm gonna mention some things that i've already touched upon first the size of the tariff rates you know i i don't know if they're going to be 145 or they're going to be cut in half there's a lot of uncertainty obviously here but there's the sense that the numbers we're talking about are way past those threshold levels of 20% that we had seen for pass through to kick in so that is actually going to be quite important there are obviously more sectors in countries potentially affected again some uncertainty here but this seems to be more about all kinds of bilateral trade deficits not just with china for the moment and across many sectors so that will increase the overall impact about 15% of the cpi is estimated to be directly affected by imports but i'll show you some results in a minute that domestic goods in those sectors can also increase so that can that can lead to to higher pressure there's also the expectation of persistence so back then i i from talking to many companies many of them were expecting a deal to be signed they were delaying the making decisions that were antagonized their customers until they there was some clarity on this and and perhaps the idea was that the trade war would go away there's something to be said about the fact that we it's clear that some of these tariffs will remain this is no longer just a temporary issue even if you look back at what happened during the biden administration many of these tariffs remained in place most of them actually so there was there's a sense that we are entering an era of more prolonged persistence of this and we are also finally let me point out coming out of a very flexible price setting environment after the pandemic many companies are very used now to to make pricing pricing decisions faster than they were two or three years ago and and that can actually lead if the shop is large enough to relatively quicker pass through there are of course some caveats to these ideas and i think this is part of what we need to figure out in the next few weeks and months first of all if trade innovation can continue and and it is possible in the sense that these are not tariffs that apply the same everywhere there is some there is a possibility that this will push some of the tariff burden onto foreign exporters if we can bring some of these goods from other locations second it's also true that tariff shock itself is not as systemic as an energy shock so i'm not expecting even if this remains quite high i'm not expecting it to be as broad and affecting as many of the subcategories that we end up seeing when we face for example in 2022 an energy shock related to the war in ukraine and finally i think this is the most important thing right now there's so much uncertainty about this that this adds delays and and reduces pass throughs many of these companies are not even sure if they're gonna be affected or not or whether the the tariffs will remain in place so this will mean that we are not likely to see much much pass through in the short run so let me actually show you what is happening right now this is the last part of of of my presentation this is a new paper we just put out together with paula jamas and and franco vasquez from university of san andres in argentina it helped me put together some of the statistics i'm gonna show you in a second i've actually updated the results so the paper is on my page but i have some new results that i i i've i've updated until just april 21 so that was three days ago so it's very live data now what should you know about these results in the type of data first these are since they're priced as prices daily in nature they're from the two largest us retailers with where we have country of origin information so these are very large companies we have we can see and and find out what is the country where these goods come from it's roughly 200,000 goods coming from about eight eight hundred countries so there is some variety there but they're highly concentrated given the nature of these retailers think of them as mass market and large retailers they sell a lot of of goods many of the goods come from from china we have about half of them from china and about 34 of them are produced in the us and the next in in in the in this list are india but notice that it's about 5% of the goats turkey taiwan etcetera so it's mostly a story about chinese goats and we do have some in canada and mexico and i'm going to show you some results as well and it's also highly concentrated in furnishing and household goods which is the ones that i was telling you before was in the aggregate data of price that's showing more of a change in trend we also have recreation and culture which is essentially electronics okay there is some food as well but relatively small size of the sample now what we do is we since we know where these goods come from we can build pricing indices for domestic goods separated from imported goods first and this is normalized to one at the october of of this year the blue is domestic the red is imported and i wanna point out a few things here first you'll notice some declines the temporary declines in the data happening around december november december those are normal patterns seasonal patterns for due to the holidays they affect more imported goods because of the categories where these goods are focused on there's a lot of electronics a lot of household goods naturally coming from china they get discounted a lot during this time and then they rebounded overall as well let me point out these downward trends are normal for these type of goods when you max model indices that are not doing adjustments for quality changes and they tend to have these downward price trends because you know technology gets replaced and and some of these goods tend to have downward cycles throughout their shelf life but so that well that's not surprising what i was a bit surprised on was what you see here in the latest part of the sample starting in in march and what surprised me is actually seeing some of these reactions to the tariffs happening relatively quickly so those the march 4 line marks the moment where the canada mexico and chinese first round of tariffs were announced of about 20 not announced sorry but implemented of about 25 they were immediately some of these goods particularly from canada and mexico were awarded exemptions due to the usmca agreement but the chinese goods continue to have tariffs that actually escalate on the second point that you see there the second liberation day when the announcements of these reciprocal massive tariffs were made and there are several things i wanna point out one is the rapid pricing response that we can see in the data and obviously these are averages you have some goods that reacted a lot more a lot less overall the magnitude i wanna point out is small even though it's quick on average the magnitude is small and you can see there on the y axis it's essentially jumping by about 2% between the first tariff being imposed on march 4 and the numbers we see until a few days ago so there's quick but small pass through and something that you many of you may have already noticed that might be surprising is the fact that domestic goods are sort of equally affected there's not much difference in how much they jump at least initially lately since april 2 the imported ones seem to be facing more inflation but the the jumps that you see here are roughly the same this is something that actually is not surprising given the literature from the first trade war several things could be happening here we this could be that domestic producers or goods have some imported inputs that may eventually be affected so there's a pricing reaction to that but more generally this could be simply reflecting the fact that there are strategic complementarities in pricing and some of the domestic producers know they'll have more pricing power when these imports face higher costs and they'll get some of these demand shifted to them that gives them also an ability to raise prices now it's interesting they haven't actually probably been affected yet but this is an anticipation of what may may happen and we see these jumps happening in in the data already now i can split that line that you see for imported goods into different countries of origin so that's what i'm doing in this chart and here you can see the difference between china mexico and canada initially i'll point out the the prices for for all of these countries jumped right after the march 4 tariffs but there's a clear divergent path here happening for chinese goods the canadian and mexican prices sort of stabilized if you will in the case of canada and mexico we've seen them decline back to levels they had in december so the i i think this is probably reflecting exceptions made to some of these goods and the expectations that a deal will be reached but the chinese goods kept on rising particularly as i as you saw in the aggregate numbers before since april 2 and that seems to be now a new trend that has not yet diminished finally i want to point out that as i showed you at the beginning domestic goods were increasing and here we can actually distinguish between domestic goods in categories that have been affected by the tariffs and categories that have not been affected imported goods i cannot make that distinction because essentially in theory they've all been affected by the reciprocal tariffs so i'm gonna just gonna put them all here again together now how do we know if it's affected or not obviously the some of the tariffs were announced at the level of countries but there are others that are at the category level and a lot of these goods have steel for example aluminum things that meant that in the end they are going to be affected and if you look at what the distinction between domestic goods that are affected and affected the ones that are in categories that are affected essentially behave similar to imported goods they have this jump and perhaps now they seem to be stabilizing while imported goods are increasing but overall the the trends the the movements the dynamics are quite similar and that could be the strategic complementarities playing a stronger role now on the other ones there's a more gradual increase but pretty sustained increase and i think this probably suggests the potential for indirect cost pressures that some of these goods may actually experience or more generally just the uncertainty about whether they might or might not be impacted in the future and that translates to a more gradual type of effect finally let me point out that there we do find sectoral variation you won't find these graphs yet in the paper where trying to get more data to have more categories represented but is this is actually showing the two sectors for which we have most data today and you can see that some of the panels i was showing you before are very similar for furnishing and households they're driven by by this sector if we look at electronics though they aren't there's no clarity yet but they don't seem to be directly affected yet and we did see some increases happening at the beginning of the year but they've tempered down perhaps there was an expectation that they were gonna be heat and and now that has diminished somewhat so this is still mostly a story about furnishing in house coal equipment we do see for example we although we have a lot less data some medical products that are sometimes coming from china those have reacted in similar patterns to what you see on on the left but it is still a sort of contained story of that sector so i'll give you a few takeaways and then i'm happy to take questions so overall if you think about price plus aggregate index there's no signs of an acceleration yet happening only in these particular subsectors of household goods and furnitures we have a high share of chinese imports i think overall when you think about inflation you have to bear in mind that this shock if the tariffs getting introduced it's not just a cost shock a negative supply shock that would push prices up but we're likely to see a negative demand shock playing in a role and and obviously oil prices have have come down this falling fuel prices or or relatively low inflation levels will tend to compensate the aggregate index so until we actually get some reaction some policy reactions i think the story will be one where we have these two potential forces combining each other in some sectors directly affected by tariffs experiencing a bit more inflation and then we would have these broader sectors like fuel potentially bringing the aggregate level down now the macro data does suggest that there's limited pass through for now consistent like i said with the research from the first trade war we do find some quick responses particularly for goods that are affected but the magnitude is still small and domestic goods are also impacted in in affected categories i think the story overall when you look at the microdata is a lot of uncertainty that is delaying some of these pricing decisions but the fact that for where you would expect to find some impact we actually do find something quickly happening suggests that there may be some quick reactions also going to happen if we get some certainty we're imagining the announcement is finally 50% and there's certainty that those are the levels we might get some quick pass through and large in size down the road so we'll keep an eye closely of course on that there's one final dimension that i wanted to to mention that we've been actually monitoring which is the possibility that product variety would fall some of you may remember that we used during the pandemic some out of stock indicators to track what was happening with product variety we've been looking at that in availability it is an important dimension here because it's it's a less noticeable impact on consumer welfare and for those of you who've been reading the news large retailers met with president trump and they mentioned this as a potential impact coming in a few weeks we have not yet seen this in our data we're keeping an eye and i think it's worthwhile considering it because even if prices are not rising because retailers decide or manufacturers decide not to pass it on sorry importers decide not to pass it on to consumers we might see a reduction in this variety that people in the us enjoy in terms of of number of goods okay good i'll leave it there and then happy to take any questions

**Speaker 0:** great yeah thanks everybody and the q and a button is what to press to put your question we've already gotten quite a few alberto so actually for the first one i'm gonna combine two of them there there was someone who was curious and i think i'd be curious as well to get your thoughts or observations on the various price elasticities of the different sectors that you're looking at and then i wanted to combine that with another question which is i i think it maybe gets to some of the final points you were just making what level of pass through actually changes consumers' minds and purchasing habits both in staples as well as in discretionary products

**Speaker 1:** okay so there are there are things that have quicker pass through to in general in in price setting things like fuel for example or food tend to have higher levels of of pass through goods like these like the ones i was showing you right now in general tend to be changed less often and therefore the pass through actually is being delayed so i was a bit surprised to see such quick though again small responses in some of these goods but i think that it was mostly because of the you know the magnitude of the announcements and and and the perception that the tensions with china were gonna continue to escalate so i think that's what's driving much of this on food i'll tell you though we do see some higher trends since the beginning of the year but that's normal for the seasonal levels and in in this particular data we did not detect much of a connection to the tariffs yet and you know i've looked at things more specific like avocados and things that i thought this is exactly where we would find it but we don't we don't see it and i think that's that's because like i said there's this perception that perhaps food being imported from mexico may not end up getting affected and that creates some uncertainty but if food products get get big tariffs i think that's where i would expect also to see some some pass through happening and that is that has a big weight on the cpi you know much bigger than than these household goods finally what level people consumers perceived as as being too high or too low there's not much research on that it's more there's there's research on what type of goods they pay more attention to when they're forming their expectation expectations and food is one of those sectors and fuel is one of those sectors i am more concerned by the fact that the size of these tariffs is beyond that 20% threshold level that i was telling you had triggered actual consumer pass through consumer retail pass through so i think it's a matter of if if we end up with levels of of 50% i think consumers will notice that and if it happens in food it is it is particularly more dramatic for for consumers

**Speaker 0:** yeah that brings up the next question i guess this is the big question for market participants especially which is kind of where inflation lands and i'm gonna i'm gonna i think it's three questions you've got somewhat related to this and you know i'll just give the backdrop which was in your presentation talking about a 2% increase that we've observed in both domestic and imported prices in a relatively short span of time that's the the kind of observation and you annualize that and it becomes quite a big number and i guess the the question that then others have asked in in similar fashion is kind of where do you see this ultimately passing through to cpi or pce you know import prices are only one part of the equation but you've pointed out that domestic prices are also rising so i think people are kind of looking for a point forecast but you know anything you could maybe offer in terms of the quantitative aspects of of those measures would be great

**Speaker 1:** yeah so obviously that's a very hard question but i see i'll tell you about dynamics i don't expect a a particularly big jump in the cpi numbers in the aggregate inflation numbers in the very short run so you can see that in our price stats data there's there's there's some pressure but there since there are sectors that are coming down and and and that's not the scenario i i envision i think there will be upward pressure obviously in sectors that get more persistent tariffs there's still a lot of uncertainty about their size and like you said i i i think those sectors will gradually get impacted because we have domestic goods also raising their prices and there's this sense that comes from microdata that there is flexibility so if the news are there and they're certain there will be some quick reactions but i think the most important takeaway if you think of the more macro number is to remember this is a supply shock that will be noisy there will be lots of delays some sectors will adjust some do not but overall it tends to push prices up and then for me the inflation question in general is more about what will happen with demand are we going to experience a confidence crisis of demand a negative demand shock that will lead to lower consumption and potentially downward pressure on prices i think we might that's the scenario i think we're looking into the next couple of months all this uncertainty you know we don't know the specific levels of the tariffs but we do know it's making consumers just like investors and everybody very anxious about the future and that tends to create problems of demand and increases the likelihood of a recession so from that perspective this might be similar to what we saw for inflation at the beginning of the pandemic that we had a negative supply shock obviously affecting the cost of production but also a negative demand shock and inflation stayed relatively constant it will be very interesting to see what happens with the fed if the fed reacts but in a way i imagine there are some questions about what the fed might might do if there is a falling demand the the fed's job becomes easier because inflation is is not the problem anymore it's more about trying to stimulate output hopefully in a measured way so that we don't end up with a situation like we saw during the pandemic it's trickier if we only see a supply shock and we end up in a more stagflationary environment for the fed because then you have the traditional problem of trying to dig with stagflation and output at the same time which the fed and any central bank struggles with

**Speaker 0:** another question is do you have a sense of how long it might take for the effects of near shoring or reshoring which is clearly a goal as part of tariffs to be reflected not just in in your data but the official data as well how long of a process might that be

**Speaker 1:** i think it takes it takes years so based on what we saw from the first trade war there's there's there's obviously some trade diversion that can happen in the short run by bringing goods that perhaps were in the in some countries directed to europe and now you can bring them to the us and things like that but these decisions to actually shift production to other countries are very slow moving because they require a lot of certainty on whether the scenarios of the tariffs will remain in place or not and i interact a lot through teaching as well with executives and my sense is that this uncertainty is still delaying many of those decisions so i i don't think it's something we can we will capture in our data or see immediately so i i i think it's more a question of who gets affected by tariffs and how competitors to those goods are reacting even though they may not have changed locations at all

**Speaker 0:** yeah and actually somewhat related to this and but tying it to the service sector really do you think tariffs could lead to both american americans and foreign consumers reducing spending on travel which might actually be a bit of a demand shock on that side

**Speaker 1:** yeah so there's i i saw there were some statistics on less tourists coming to the us it's it's i i don't know if it's necessarily about the tariffs itself but just fear of all the immigration policies and some of the things that come with some of these announcements no but services in this sense are more affected by the potential fear of the future the recession demand side effects not necessarily by tariffs i hope we don't start inputting tariffs on services as well yeah

**Speaker 0:** going in back to the data i think this is a question you and i talked about on the podcast this week more on that to come but someone noted the bigger reaction in furnishings and household equipment prices versus electronics prices given they're both heavily dominated by imports and presumably imports from china as well can we talk about maybe first of all why we haven't seen such pressures in electronics as we have in furnishings and when and whether we might see broader contagion from tariffs in those sectors like that or even apparel something like that as well

**Speaker 1:** that's a good question actually electronics were were not yet impacted by the tariff announcements they've been given exemptions and very prominently i think it was last week that the administration mentioned that they were not going to or that they were gonna give you a lot of exemptions to that so if you actually look at the sectors that we classify as affected in in those charts those are mostly household goods which are as well the biggest part of our sample but it's interesting when i let me show you again if you look at the dynamics that we had for electronics there were some increases there was obviously some sales and then they increased further up and around this time around march and april we started seeing those prices come back down i think it's probably because there's an expectation that electronics may not end up getting affected but we'll see there's one dimension here that this data is not capturing which is the elimination of the the restrictions for small amounts you know when you buy in in chinese retailers that send directly into the us those exceptions have been removed and i honestly at these days don't even remember if they have promised to back them down or not but my sense is that they are in place and that's not something we would capture except for some competitive effects that might take some time to actually be seen so

**Speaker 0:** yeah actually a question there's a few more left and by the way we have about ten twelve minutes before alberto will need to go but a question just to kinda take i think a step back a bit in talking about the consistency of price stats with core cpi it's sort of more of a holistic question can you just talk a little bit about the linkages to that and and the consistency between the two

**Speaker 1:** yeah so our data and our index is very good at some of these sectors like household goods that's very well represented in electronics all kinds of goods even food and fuel were captured by our indices we do sometimes tend to have deviations that happened with the cpi those are mostly because of services and in particular housing pricing price changes i'm going back to show you some of the monthly rates so those spikes that you see here in the cpi those are mostly coming from sectors that we don't have in our data like housing for which we have some complementary goals that capture well the overall trends or long term trends but not you know particular jumps if if housing is greatly affected now this crisis does not seem to be like covid in that sense that it may generate these big spikes there was also a big spike by the way here happening in the cpi in january so some of you may remember the january numbers came up higher than than expected in the cpi a part of that was that eggs had increased by 15% and the cpi has a smaller sample that puts a lot of weight on some of these goods so we jumped up and people were concerned we were gonna see again something like q one of twenty twenty four and there i think our our data was good to tell us there's there's some upward pressure but this is an overshooting that is happening with the cpi and you can see actually the cpi falling back to to these levels so i i i like seeing these differences because it i know you know this ours is more closely related to goose with larger samples and it tells us more about the trends of inflation rather than some volatility that may happen for for you know various factors in in the cpi

**Speaker 0:** yeah another question on the comparison to previous inflation regimes particularly covid that i thought was really interesting have you noticed within the data whether any particular sectors or companies which had strong pricing power in the post covid inflation era 2021 '20 '20 '2 having similar power now and being able to move prices up now even whether they're exposed to tariffs or not are they exhibiting that pricing power that they they exhibited back then do you do you get that sense

**Speaker 1:** so we we don't do much analysis at the brand or manufacturer level actually i i don't do any of that i can tell you at the retailer level we the the i don't see dynamics that are particularly different from what we had seen in covid usually the prices that we can collect this way they do tend to react faster than what we see in the cpi and it's perhaps too early to tell if there's this is gonna be so different but i don't i don't foresee you know much difference in the sample covid was special for the cpi and our data in the sense that a lot of the cpi data at the time could actually not be collected so it led to changes in the sampling methodology of the cpi that that created some volatility initially but right now i don't think we're likely to see any of that happening at all so we'll we'll we'll see what happens yeah

**Speaker 0:** couple more questions and we still have time i think if you wanted to submit maybe one or two more but a question on currency effects you know we've had a weaker dollar the last couple of months and it's not necessarily come against the renminbi as much but other currencies and you know i'm just wondering if that is also playing a role or whether you can tell if it's playing a role and then also just how fx effects or the effects of currencies play into the data that you're looking at

**Speaker 1:** yeah so that's a great question actually if you look at the results i have for the first paper there we looked at the tariff effect and we also have some results on how the rmb depreciation at the time so the stronger dollar might have might be helping importers in the us and if you go back to that paper and look at the results you'll find a pass through rate that is relatively low for for exchange rate shocks but very consistent with the literature particularly in the us since these goods are priced in dollars internationally there is a little little pass through and it takes a long time for it to have an effect what's different this time versus the first trade war was that back then the dollar appreciated as you would expect when you impose a tariff because there's gonna be lower imports and and that tends to appreciate the currency but what's new now is that we're actually seeing a depreciation of the dollar so that could make things worse from a pricing perspective but i don't think it's playing a big role because that exchange rate pass through we've always found in the case of the us is low it's going in the bad direction if you will the fact that the us dollar is depreciating but my sense is yet this is not a major factor though we will test it in our paper once we start running regressions just like we did in the first trade war we can actually find out these magnitudes but we need more time for that yeah

**Speaker 0:** couple of questions on inflation expectations and the first one is on consumer inflation expectations which of course have ramped up and and done so even really before tariffs were implemented and and prices haven't really reflected the impact of tariffs yet do you see those consumer expectations as being potentially self fulfilling

**Speaker 1:** no i i i wouldn't pay too much attention to consumer expectations right now i've done some work on that in the past and and they're noisy even in you know normal times and there's so much volatility right now that i think there's there's like a growing concern that this may be a problem but whether that translates into actual actions or not will take some time and if i were at the fed i wouldn't be looking reading too much into that i think they're going to be quite volatile there's the investors' expectations about inflation that could be quite important but just to read on what they think may be the final outcome or how the policy will change but on the consumer side until we don't see impacts on food for example i think they they will simply be volatile

**Speaker 0:** and that you've actually taken i think my follow-up question to that which is actually the final question i should say unless anyone can type one in in the next couple of minutes but market based inflation expectations have moved in the opposite direction really or at least have been very subdued and and not really broken out of you know they they they've certainly not been elevated they've they've if anything been pointing more to the downside is that something that perhaps brings the fed more worry they've cited market based inflation expectations a couple of times in commentary recently and i'm wondering if that maybe influences them a bit more

**Speaker 1:** it could lead them to think that the market expects a recession is coming that's that's what you mean yes but it's at this stage i think there's there's there's growing the growing sense that all this uncertainty will lead to some confidence crisis so that is something that i think the fed already knows and and and is concerned about there's the opposite side which is the upward pressure or inflation that's where i think there's a lot more uncertain less clarity let's say today and i honestly don't think we can say much about that until we actually get some some policy announcements that look like they're not gonna be back down or or changed in in in very quick succession

**Speaker 0:** yeah very good well alberto we have exhausted the audience's questions as well as my own so thanks to all of you for listening and participating as a a final sign off i wanted to talk about two things alberto's actually already mentioned one of them which is that we've restarted a weekly document that will update you on the latest trends in the price stats data that comes out well this week's is already out i think it'll come out around the middle of the week we did something similar to this during the pandemic it was a great way to keep track of things like supply chain issues and trends in these alternative data sources i suspect the same will very much be true this time around alberto is also my guest on this week's edition of street signals which is our macro and markets podcast that i host that's coming out tomorrow morning london and boston time and in the afternoon in asia we talk about a lot of the things that alberto talked about today but also some things we didn't get to cover so check that out i wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't ask you to subscribe and to promote that but thanks everyone again for joining and for all the great questions really appreciate it thank you
