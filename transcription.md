**Speaker 0:** so again when i break it down to kind of first principles and do a comparative advantage the us just has a despite all those problems still has a number of advantages and because of all those advantages and because of all the challenges that the other countries have i think once we get through this period of hey you're being a really mean guy and i don't like the way you're saying that to me think once people really have to make a decision when countries really have to make a decision i don't think they will choose china over the united states for a whole number of reasons

**Speaker 1:** welcome to thoughtful money i'm its founder and your host adam taggart of all the disruptive policies president trump has made so far in his second term his hardball strategy to reform global trade has received the most scorn his detractors call it nonsensical and ham fisted that it's based on faulty logic poor math and has done grave injury to relations with our closest allies they fear it's actually driving the rest of the world into china's our chief competitor's arms and as a result substantially damaging america's future prospects is this true and is this the reason why bond yields are rising the dollar is weakening and gold is soaring and most importantly will china end up drinking america's milkshake for answers we're fortunate to welcome back to the program brent johnson ceo and portfolio manager at santiago capital and publisher of the macro alchemist brent it's great to see you again thanks so much for joining us today

**Speaker 0:** yeah sure thanks for the invite

**Speaker 1:** hey you're very welcome well for the question of is china going to drink america's milkshake couldn't think of anybody better to talk about this with than the developer of the dollar milkshake theory there's a lot going on a lot to talk about if you don't mind brent let me just start by reading something that you just recently wrote at the malcro alchemist in your post the donald and the damage done where basically you said that anyone who's been surprised by the liberation day tariff drama well then they haven't been paying attention close enough attention let me read this quick session here alright you said quote america is telling the world exactly what's coming this is not the chaos of decline this is not the flailing of a fading empire this is the world's dominant power consolidating its control unapologetically aggressively and with the full weight of its economic engine behind it and the playbook is not subtle the trump administration has thrown out the ivory tower frameworks of globalization free trade and rules based cooperation and replace them with something far older simpler and more ruthless realpolitik and statecraft backed by financial warfare tariffs are not policy details they are pressure points supply chains are not economic abstractions they are leverage and foreign governments and multinational ceos are not partners they are counterparties in a zero sum contest for control access to the american market the largest wealthiest and most consumption driven in human history is no longer free it will come with a price but power moves like this do not come without consequences global capital is shifting markets are trembling foreign holders of us assets lulled for decades by predictability and privilege are discovering that what the us giveth the us can take it away this is not about trade policy and it's not about tariffs it's about power who has it who does not and what happens when the world's largest economy decides to stop pretending otherwise alright so very clearly to you

**Speaker 0:** very subtle right very subtle

**Speaker 1:** but yeah but but but in your eyes it's actually very clear what's going on it it's not a a chaos of people just making stuff up on the fly who don't know what they're doing you're saying no no no this is a very clear strategy and it's actually not even that complex it's quite simple it's all about power at the end of the day and this may be one of the biggest power flexes the world has seen in recent decades so i want to dig into all this with you but if we can let me just start with this do you think just asking you for your best assessment of probabilities do you think that this plan is likely to work

**Speaker 0:** well it depends on who for i guess is the question

**Speaker 1:** i would immediately ask let's start for americans well

**Speaker 0:** then we have to figure out which set of americans so i would say overall yes but it will not be easy and it will not be smooth and there will be great pain involved in it working i think the best way for me to describe what's happening is not just what i i stand by everything that you just said and that i wrote but at the end of the day in really simplified terms the united states is changing the way it does business with the world and changing the way it has interacted with the world for the last half a century or more even under the best circumstances that would be a very volatile transition i think it's easy to look at the world and say we don't have the best circumstances under which to try to do this i don't think it will work perfectly but i do think it will work better than many seem to think it will i'm open to being wrong and nothing in this world is certain but i think when we get down the road another nine months a year and we get more clarity on how this is actually going to work and what policies are ultimately going to be put in place i'm not as apocalyptic as many people are

**Speaker 1:** okay well then let me ask you this brent by when do you think we will start to see that this is working and if it's going to work and what will you be looking at to be able to judge that it is indeed working

**Speaker 0:** yeah that that is a very good question and i think we gotta be careful how we how we say whether or not it's working to be clear i think this is going to be a very volatile year it's already been volatile i think when we spoke in the in the summer or last fall i mentioned that my plan for 2025 is that i thought it would be very similar to 2022 and if you remember 2022 it was a complete regime change from an interest rate perspective the world hadn't seen anything like that in a very long time i thought with trump coming in it was a regime change and we were going to see things that the world had not seen in a very long time so i think the next three or four months into it think for the next four or five six months we're going to continue to have volatility and we'll probably see lower prices in markets and asset prices guess i think by q4 maybe by early next year we will start to potentially see some benefits of what i think is going to happen and when i say benefits it doesn't necessarily mean that the stock prices are back at their all time highs and there's no more volatility but what i mean is that i do think companies around the world will move production here i do think manufacturing to some extent will come back i do think wage pressures will rise because better paying jobs will come back i don't think it's going to be perfect and i don't think it's necessarily going to work as well as trump thinks it will work but i don't think it's not going to work at all i think it will work and i do think the us has the most important market in the world and i think weaponizing for lack of a better way of saying it the us consumer market will work better than many think it will

**Speaker 1:** okay and you know i see you take care to say hey look i don't necessarily mean that we're going to see the stock market rush off to new all time highs listening to the administration i am not sure that that is their primary goal here totally they like it and i think they hope it will be a secondary result but if we take them at face value there's always some danger in doing that but if we take them at face value and they're saying look it's wall street's had its time it's now time for main street my sense is they are their scorecard is much more about a national security but also you know we want to restore manufacturing both for national security reasons but also you know we want to we want to try to rebuild the middle class in this society and so they're going to be measuring it more in terms of jobs in terms of growth of industry things like that not necessarily by the s and p price

**Speaker 0:** i completely agree with you i think we have to throw in there what the us is able to accomplish geopolitically over the next year as well because all of this in my opinion there's two primary goals number one make america great again whether you agree with what that means it doesn't matter that's what he wants to achieve when i say he i mean trump and the secondary thing is the containment of china i think everything is ultimately about making america great and containing china when we talk about mexico and canada we're really talking about china when we talk about europe we're really talking about china again i wouldn't necessarily choose for it to be this way but this is what's happening and i don't think this is going to stop and i actually don't think if trump were somehow removed and he was no longer the president i think this would still be the game because i think the genie's out of the bottle and i think that's where the dice have been thrown and this is what's happening

**Speaker 1:** mhmm mhmm so you know what's interesting about this is you know you you said look if if you're surprised by this then you weren't paying attention because unlike many past you know politicians trump has been incredibly consistent and transparent and quite vocal that he was gonna do pretty much exactly what he's done here i would say and look folks i should have opened with this know that this is not a partisan political discussion we're just talking about it because it's the political regime that we currently have right now yeah the die has been cast and we're all our lot is is tied to all this right yep the one thing that i'm i i'm not i i think trump could have done a better job at i i i guess you could there there there's a lot of criticism that's been launched with him saying look he surprised wall street and everybody with these reciprocal tariffs which turned out not to be reciprocal tariffs but turned out to be tariffs plus a whole bunch of other stuff that caught a lot of people by surprise and you know i can i can argue both sides of that coin because i think to a certain extent i mean part of part of it is you know the negotiator is not gonna reveal all those cards before he plays them and i think he i think he did kinda wanna catch not necessarily wall street by surprise but but but but wanted to catch the attention of of all the trade players he's trying to wrangle together but we could argue there was a communication error there the the the one that i would probably argue is that this whole trade kerfuffle that's going on right now i do believe that the intent there is to get better trade deals you know on average with everybody for america going forward hopefully you know repairing as much hurt feelings as we can along the way but but i think the number one thing there is to ring fence china which you said earlier right and i i i'm i'm not sure that trump was as vocal as as i perhaps think he should have been either on the campaign trail or once he got elected saying hey everybody i'm gonna prioritize ring faith in china over a lot of other things right now and and we as a this is this is a national priority we as a country should rally around this let me make the case for you why china's bad right now and and and we all gotta sacrifice a bit to really bring china to heel so i feel like the american public has just gotten tied to this you know we're we're gonna try to shove china in a box strategy and i think a lot of people just weren't brought along well enough in that to really understand the why behind it all and that's one of the reasons why people are are just sort of wondering why the hell are we doing all this right now right do you have an opinion on that

**Speaker 0:** yeah don't think you're wrong on that and i wouldn't argue against that too strongly what i would say is that don't think what he is doing is totally out of line what he was saying earlier i think he's actually been pretty clever and i know nobody ever wants to ascribe anything positive to him but i think he has been relatively clever with the way he has dealt with china even in his first term and now he's always said i don't blame xi i don't blame china they work really hard they've done a great job they've raised themselves out of poverty and he never really speaks badly about china other than that they beat the hell out of the right right right and then he always blames it on the us leadership and us business leaders and etcetera etcetera

**Speaker 1:** right i mean he says they lie and they cheat and they steal but he says but i get it they can get away with it my predecessors let them yeah

**Speaker 0:** yeah and and and that's probably the right way to go about it right if if he were to come out on the campaign trail and just rail against china maybe he doesn't win the presidency right and so maybe he does but maybe he doesn't and i think i i should step back too i want to be clear and this will lead into what i think we will also talk about but i think it's important to remember that trump envisions himself as two things the greatest president ever and the greatest dealmaker ever so that means two things number one if you're going to be on mount rushmore and be considered the greatest president ever you cannot be the president when china ascends to become the global superpower you have to contain your political rival if you are going to continue to be or if you have any hope of being viewed as the greatest american president that's number one but he also thinks of himself as somebody who is great for business and great for markets and a great dealmaker so what he doesn't want is china to collapse because if china collapses the whole world goes into chaos and so he doesn't want a global depression i think he's willing to accept a recession but he doesn't want a global financial crisis and a global collapse because that's not good for anybody what he wants is to be president of the world that's what his ego wants and i think he wants the us to be the shining city on the hill in that global world of his and i think he wants everybody to be doing a lot of trade with the united states under those circumstances now the reality is you can't get all those things but that's what he wants and so that's what he's going to try to get but i don't think that he wants to rule over a world of smoldering ashes i know some people believe that he would but i don't think that's the case because that brings in just too many negative things and it's hard to put a positive spin on a global financial crisis but if you can say you know if you can go through a couple hard months or a couple hard years have a recession and then by the end of your term be coming on the way out of it and having delivered on some of the things you promised you would that i think he would love

**Speaker 1:** yeah and that just to go back to my criticism that's where i think maybe he is falling a little short here on the communication side of things which is to get the public behind hey this may require some belt tightening where we may have to go through a recession in a couple of lean years but it's all going to be so much better on the other side he's done i think some of that on the sort of like look the economy i inherited was so bad you know i'm going to have to do some repair work and that's you know that's why i've got my whole big checklist here of everything from trade to tax cuts to deregulation to doge and all that stuff but but the china part i'm just not sure he's he pre sold that to the american people again it's sort of moot at this point

**Speaker 0:** no i agree well i agree with that i agree with that

**Speaker 1:** yeah so i guess first and foremost let's talk about china and then we'll expand the beam here so first and foremost do you do you agree that this is the right thing to be doing with china i mean sort of as best i understand the general situation it seems like there's a lot of there there certainly heard a lot of other countries as well make the same complaint actually sorry real quick before before we get specifically to china something i've said on my program a lot i'd love to get your your your thoughts too so i i yeah a lot of people have said hey how come why did this all have to be so fast and so chaotic and so heavy handed right why couldn't trump have gone and made nice to all of our allies and and you know initiated a charm offensive and then gotten a coalition of the willing and then tried to do all this and i don't i don't know the answer to that i'm obviously not privy to the president and his cabinet's interior thinking but my sense is as they felt they they couldn't either they didn't have enough time or they didn't think that that strategy was would would would would play out they had enough probability of playing out the way they don't want it or whatnot so i i feel like what trump did is he just called everybody at the poker table he basically said look we all gonna put our call i'm calling everybody everybody put your cards down and he's just betting that he's got the best hand and and to your point from from what i read here you know he thinks sort of his trump card pardon the pun but his trump card is i control access to the world's biggest consuming economy that everybody wants to play in and everybody kind of needs to play in and so you know he calls the table says look if you get a better hand than me great fine i'll have to bend the knee to you but if not you get to bend the knee to me if you still want to sell into my market here and it ruffled a lot of feathers right everybody to a certain extent was benefiting from that status quo maybe benefiting at america's expense to different degrees and trump is now basically saying look i want you to fall in line i put out my big poster board which was the big stick i was threatening to hit you with now you call me on the phone we're gonna negotiate something that's gonna be way better than that poster board i had and probably have some nice big carrots in there for you but part of that deal making i'm sure is whatever deal we strike you could agree that you're on team america when it comes to china and so basically he was using this this calling of everybody at the poker table as a as an accelerator to get as many people as possible as quickly as possible or as many countries as possible as quickly as possible on america's side so that he could then apply maximum pressure to china do you see it similarly

**Speaker 0:** i think that's a perfect analogy think that's exactly what he did because if you were to try to achieve what he is trying to achieve under normal methods right don't think you would even get more than two steps before you start getting stymied by committees and conference calls and trade meetings and summits and all this kind of stuff i think at best it would be september october november before you had a legitimate sit down right because each side would want to take a few months to do some internal studies and figure out our most important points and that's how government has typically worked and that's why things drag on so long that's partly why the us is in the situation that it's in and i think that he believes and i think the people around him believes that if you're going to do the changes that he wants to do there's really only one way to do them and i tend to agree with that i don't like it really but i don't if you were going to try to change the way the united states does business and you were going to try to change the inequality in the united states between the top 1% and the lower 99 and you were going to try to bring better jobs back and you were going to try to make it so that a family of four didn't have to work three jobs and live on minimum wage i don't really know how else you would go about it than what he's doing now i'm sure there's some people out there who have some ideas but i think largely those ideas have been proposed before and then they just get abandoned because they're really really hard to do and anytime you make a transition like this there is going to be political pain and the reality is most politicians can't stand even a little bit of pain this is one area where i think trump's a little different than most politicians i think he largely has the ability to withstand pain because he just really doesn't care what anybody else thinks

**Speaker 1:** theoretically even though today he just put out a cap for trump twenty twenty eight but theoretically he's not running for reelection right right

**Speaker 0:** well and the thing is i think this is his greatest strength but oftentimes your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness right and the fact that he doesn't listen to anybody and he thinks he knows everything and it's his way or the highway that can be a real detriment and i think we're seeing some of that but it's also a big skill to have if you operate in the public eye you are always going to get criticized every president in history has been criticized every president in history the other side has wanted to impeach him for some unforgivable expense

**Speaker 1:** or

**Speaker 0:** episode and so i think he's just trying to just bull in a china chop run through it and get it changed i don't remember if we've talked about this before but the similar analogy i've met or used is malay in argentina i mean that guy has just taken a chainsaw to everything and just gone 100 miles an hour and i think that's why he has largely been successful so far now he's still got problems too and there's no guarantee it's gonna work in the end but i think the reason he has been successful so far is he has moved too fast for anybody to catch him and to me trump has already played his hand to me the faster he moves the better he's going to be if he slows down he can slow down a little bit and again i think he had to slow down because you don't want a crisis but i think if he tries to go back and play mr nice guy it's politically over him

**Speaker 1:** yeah yeah to a certain extent he's kind of taken a cortez strategy where he has burned his ships right he's he's fully committed an interesting this is not just a geopolitical strategy it's the same strategy that his administration has taken domestically right with with doge and everything and i've i've heard you know scott besson it say yes we we intentionally have been moving as as fast as we can here because we know and we know we're gonna break some things in the process and we'll just have to repair them as we go so that because if we if we went too slow it would give the chance for the the inertia of the establishment to then admire us right the lawyers would get involved the lobbyists would get involved we would just be basically fighting bureaucracy every step along the way exactly so maybe they they did look at malay and say look that that we gotta we gotta borrow that same playbook so anyways least he's consistent so the reason why i wanted to drill into that is just to put words in your mouth correct them if they're wrong is you may like it you may hate it but you shouldn't really criticize it that it's there is method to the madness it's not just you know chaotic loose cannon out of control you know getting reinvented every day type of you know an approach it actually is a very intentional approach now you don't have to love it but it just it's not being made up on the fly is what you would say

**Speaker 0:** no i mean i don't think it's three d chess at all i think this is the guy walking onto the playground with the biggest hammer and just saying guys this is the way it is it's not sophisticated it's just

**Speaker 1:** it's power

**Speaker 0:** psychic it's it's power it's pure and simple and here's here's the interesting thing about this and i know you you've talked with michael every before and he's you know he's somebody i've i've i've become pretty close with and we we see many things very similarly and whenever i talk about this stuff and i'm going to say this because in case somebody new is listening i know some people have heard me say this before but whenever i come at this i'm coming at this from a asset allocation money making perspective it's not my job to pass moral judgment on what's happening it's my job to remove my emotions from it just look at what's going to happen figure out what's going to happen and then try to make money off of it and i think many people in my profession over

**Speaker 1:** the

**Speaker 0:** last fifty years have had the luxury of when they invest in developed markets let's call it of just looking at the numbers just looking at it from an economics and finance perspective and i think those who focused on emerging markets or non developed markets or frontier markets they have always had to put a certain level of political risk geopolitical analysis on top of it it was never just a numbers game and i think many people who focused on it just being a numbers game and does the cash flow net present value come out to be positive i think they're having to rethink the way they do business and the way they decide what to invest in because i think the last fifty years has been fairly unique i wouldn't say unique in history but it's been fairly unique over the last couple of hundred years and much of history because for much of history it wasn't peaceful and it was very much based on power and it was very much based on the woke the local king or queen or governor saying this is the way it is just go do it and i think many of us grew up in this golden age of peace and tranquility now know there's people that are listening in and they grew up in some place that wasn't peaceful and tranquil but in general those of us in the west have benefited from that and i think in many ways those days are gone and i don't like saying that but i kind of feel like they are

**Speaker 1:** well you aren't the only one saying this as you mentioned michael ebery has been saying this for a long time in fact he was predicting it for a long time you know ringing the bell saying that globalization is the anomaly and and mercantilism is much more the norm and and it certainly seems the pendulum has swung very quickly towards mercantilism way faster than most people thought he also says his his new little catchphrase or one of his new little catchphrase is dm equals em right which is that developed markets are going to start looking and operating a lot more like emerging markets which is exactly what you just said

**Speaker 0:** and russell napier made this call four or five years ago he said if i was the head of a major bank i would fire the developed market heads and i would promote the emerging market guys to the developed market desks and it's i mean every day that becomes more and more prescient

**Speaker 1:** well i wonder if any bank ever did that i'm sure they're going to be much better positioned as a result of that all right now i wanted to get to china so know china big player does seem to be quite guilty of a lot of unfair trade policies and practices not just the us and many other players if you have anything you wanna say about that one way or the other please do but where i'm going with this is you know you've said look trump wants to bring china to heel but he doesn't want it to fall into crisis right that that that doesn't solve it that doesn't serve the interests of of of global economy and a lot of people here and this is going to my my the heart of my question to you will china end up drinking america's milkshake right so there are there is a cadre of people who say look china's the rising power america's is the the fading power trump has picked a battle here that he can't win he's pissing off all of everybody else on the global geopolitical chessboard and driving them into china's arms i don't necessarily think you think that's the case but if you could sort of address your answer to that and then so also talk about as you talk about in your piece china's got a lot of things to deal with right now like it it you know trump trump may be picking a good time to to to push back on china here because china's already kind of on its heels being stuck in a in a balance sheet recession having you know this incredibly morbid real estate industry which is where the majority of their citizens hold their wealth it's got a big demographic problem population is actually shrinking now which is hard for people to wrap their brains around but it's actually the population of china is now going down after rising so much over the past fifty plus years any and all that i just mentioned there around china you know what are its prospects here

**Speaker 0:** well mean i don't think they're great and i know people are it's funny because i i i i've been doing this for so long now i anticipate the the points that people are going to give back to me as i make my comments and so i'm going to answer the china question but i'm going to set this up as saying my whole framework the whole dollar milkshake thesis was born out of the fact that the united states has incredible problems incredible challenges they've made numerous mistakes and this is going to be the consequences the consequence or consequences of all those mistakes and the debt is perhaps the one that people like to focus on the most and if the us had kind of maneuvered itself into this position while the rest of the world or even one other part of the world had done any better i would probably agree with those who are i call them the american fatalists who think that there's just no way the us can remain on top but that's not the case the fact is the rest of the world has made all the same mistakes or many of the same mistakes and they are not fighting back from a position of strength they are in fact themselves in a weakened position and when i say that i mean europe i mean china i mean south america you go around the world they all have similar problems and the other point i would make is that all the sins of the united states do not bestow sainthood on its competitors and i think it's very easy to look at our leadership and all the mistakes we've made and say god these guys are a bunch of clowns and then automatically think that the rest of the world is run by geniuses but that's just not the case it is a relative game so now i'll bring it back to china

**Speaker 1:** the fact

**Speaker 0:** is if the united states is driving the rest of the world away i do not think that they are running into the arms of china i think that will be borne out over the next year or the next couple of years however long this whole thing plays out now if i am wrong and you see that europe and south america and everybody else aligns both politically strategically and economically with china and the united states is all on its own then i will raise up my hand and say you know what i was wrong you were right.' and i think that's a pretty low probability even if that were to happen i think the us could still compete pretty well against that and i say that because the us despite all its problems it just has so many incredible natural advantages and whatever that so let's just let's just wargame it out let's say that that does happen let's say five years from now the rest of the world is aligned cohesively and it's us all by itself i don't think the transition period to go from here to there is going to be a smooth one and because of all those other countries and all those other pieces also have the same challenges that we have i think in that interim the united states can outperform them and if every country had to be self sufficient and i don't think we're going back to a world where there is no trade and every country just produces everything it needs internally but if that had to happen i think the us has everything that it would absolutely need it might not have everything that it wants but it would have everything that it needs and i don't think that can be said for the rest of the world so again when i break it down to kind of first principles and do a comparative advantage the us just has a despite all this problem still has a number of advantages and because of all those advantages and because of all the challenges that the other countries have i think once we get through this period of hey you're being a really mean guy and i don't like the way you're saying that to me i think once people really have to make a decision when countries really have to make a decision i don't think they will choose china over the united states for a whole number of reasons and we can kind of get into that i think that's the case and that means then what so let's say that i'm right for a second let's just assume that i'm right and so now china has all this production they have all this manufacturing capability who are they going to sell to well they would have to sell it internally and there's this theory called say's law well equals demand however much you can produce then that equals demand because it just offsets what's produced the people that produce it they're making money from it so then they need to buy stuff but the reality is china cannot sell all of their inventory internally or even locally in their region at the same prices that they could sell them to the united states so yeah if they had to dump all their inventory all their production domestically or within the asian region they're going to have to do it at lower prices and therefore the revenue is going to fall the problem is china has borrowed a lot more money than the united states has if you look at the rate of growth of china over the last twenty five years it's higher than the united states and their economy has levered two or three times more than the united states economy is levered so what that means is if their revenue falls the revenue cannot cover all that debt that's been taken out and then some people will say yeah but they've loaned it all internally they can just write it off okay that's fine so then what's the outlet valve well the outlet valve is the currency the current you know if you write off all these bad loans internally and you print to cover them then your currency falls in value and the reason that that would hurt china more than it hurts the united states is there is zero external demand outside of china for yuan nobody outside of china needs the yuan but as of it stands right now today everybody outside the united states needs dollars now that may change someday and i know many people are working on ways to change that but right now today from a purely hardcore perspective the rest of the world still needs dollars to operate on the global stage and if nothing else to service all their us dollar debts and us dollar invoices that they trade in and so again i think china has incredible set of skills and an incredible set of advantages and incredible capabilities and so this is not me saying china's a bunch of idiots that's not it at all it's just that they have a number of challenges as well and i always find it kind of funny when i ask people what's the biggest problem the united states have and they always say it's the debt there's no way they can handle all the debt and then i say okay well the rest of the world has all that debt as well what are they going to do and they say well they'll just walk away from it okay well does the rest of the world get to walk away from their debt with no consequences but the united states can't walk away from its debt with no consequences again i think the biggest lesson i had to learn in this business was stripping away my my kind of my belief system from a moral perspective or what i wanted to see happen and just say you have to be just brutally you know a mercenary when you're looking at these things it doesn't matter what should happen it doesn't matter who's the nice guy doesn't matter what would be the nicest way to handle this is what's going to be the result and i think when you strip that away i think the us is still in pretty good shape on a relative basis

**Speaker 1:** so let me just interrupt to support that point to your point about power you gave a great presentation back in the fall at a conference we were at it was at brian london's new orleans conference and and it was all about power and it was really kind of equating money with power at the end of the day what really is money right and and your your challenge to the audience was don't even necessarily think about it as a means of exchange or a story about you at its basest core what is it and it really is a projection of power and to use the example of the you know the biggest goon in the prison yard right that you know you kind of like it or not everybody has to do what he says as long as he can back up his statements with his brawn and to your point there about you got to put your morality to the side for a moment and just think mercenarily if x happens what's likely to happen and why i always think about back to when i was born i was born one of the last people to be born when america was still when the dollar was still tied to gold i think it was like mhmm three weeks yeah three weeks after i was born nixon severed the final ties and i think that's a great example of what you're talking about where you know basically the us got boxed into a corner based on its policies that the rest of the world woke up and said hey you know what i don't think the us has really enough gold to back the dollars that it's issuing and other countries started calling that by siphoning out our gold and nixon finally just said alright you know what i'm shutting the gold window and you know what the dollar is no longer tied to gold and you know what everybody eat it right like you're stuck with us you need our dollars right i know you don't like me all of a sudden telling you you can't exchange them for gold anymore but what are you gonna do you're all too dependent on me and this may be another one of those moments right where where trump is saying look i know everybody you're kind of happy with the status quo i think you've been getting a bit of a raw deal and you know what i am i am basically taking away or threatening to take away your access to the american market unless you concede to these things i'm asking you to do and if you don't like it then eat it because what else are you going to do and do you see this as sort of another seminal moment of that same flavor

**Speaker 0:** you know what i i i think that's a very good very i i it's a perfect example and i'm glad you brought it up because i i i actually of revisiting that whole period in time kind of helped me crystallize my thoughts on what's going on today it's perfect in many ways the reason it's perfect is because that was a time period where it wasn't america's enemies getting frustrated with it it was america's allies getting frustrated with it nixon wasn't really super liked nixon was kind of a bully nixon didn't talk as prettily as prettily i don't know is that a word he doesn't talk as nicely as as jfk right he didn't come across on television as the nice warm grandfatherly type do we know anybody else that's kind of along those same lines right now right and and when the us allies started to say hey you know what we're just not comfortable with the way you're running things anymore and they started to france most sternly said this and they took their gold away there was rumblings that england might do the same or germany might do the same and that's really what led nixon to do that and that was not a popular move when he did that and that caused all kinds of uncertainty and there was believe me there was people at investment conferences and writing newsletters and stuff saying this is the end of the dollar they just you know they just delinked it from gold it's no longer backed by anything us has been printing money like crazy to pay for all of the johnson administration's social programs and these wars all over the world vietnam and cambodia there's no way that we can you know keep spending like this and you know you can see the kids are no longer you know doing what they used to do there are you know these hippies out in san francisco and there was all these social movements and there's a lot of parallels in the early 70s to right now but you fast forward ten years and all of the us allies were still doing business with the united states i think at the time john connolly said hey it's our currency but it's your problem and despite all of those problems despite all of the challenges the us figured out a way to keep it going and now do i know for sure that's going to happen again no i don't know for sure but all the people who automatically say there's no way they can keep this going for another ten or twenty years i'm like well come on there's no way i think you've got to keep a little bit of an open mind maybe there's a way i'm going to give another quick example too because i know your audience would probably like this if i haven't mentioned this before and you may have as well but there's a book called the storm before the storm

**Speaker 1:** you have mentioned it but talk about it

**Speaker 0:** and so you know i came across it about five years ago six years ago because my friend mike my friend mike and i we used to go on these hikes once a month and we talk markets and stuff and he one time he said have you read the storm before the storm and i said no and the next month he said hey did you read this yet and i said no and then the third month he said did you read this yet and i said no and he finally got mad at me he's like what the hell is wrong with you read the book and so i read the book and i was like holy cow and so what it is is it's basically a history of rome from the year 01/2020 to sixty bc so it's like a sixty seventy year period and it was sixty or seventy years before the fall of the roman republic and what's really interesting is during that sixty year period the similarities between that and the united states are uncanny i i can't even begin to tell you all the same issues that we deal with now that they were dealing with then whether it was illegal immigration whether it was inflation whether it was political infighting whether it was the wars on the other side of the world mean it was just on tiktok

**Speaker 1:** on and on yeah

**Speaker 0:** yeah i mean it just the similarities were just incredible but in that sixty year period there were so many periods where it went this way and it went that way it went this way and it went that way and just when you think it can't go on any longer well then it does and then the other faction comes in and takes it the other way and the point is as though even though it was steadily declining it's not a straight line these things typically don't happen overnight they typically happen over a very long time period just when you think things can't possibly be saved they are and then not only that when the book ends i think it's like sixty bc book ends just before caesar comes to power that was when the fall of the republic well what people forget is that rome lasted for another four hundred years after this that's when it went into the empire and so i don't think that we're even in the empire stage with the us now i'm not sitting here saying the us will be in power for the next four hundred years i'm just saying those who believe this automatically has to end tomorrow because the us has just overstayed its welcome and it's a dying empire it takes a long time for these things to play out and i'm the first to admit that this can could get kicked down the road for another four eight twelve sixteen twenty years i don't know for sure when this is going to play out think a lot of people especially in today's instant gratification society they want it all over in the next six months or all over in the next six weeks and that's just not going to happen this is going to take years to play out

**Speaker 1:** all right and just so i'm really clear when you're saying this can take years to play out are you talking about the redrawing of global trade that we're talking about here or are you talking about america's debt crisis

**Speaker 0:** i think all of it right i think all of it listen is it possible that in the next six months we have a global catastrophe all the debt comes down and we get a global reset sure it's possible you should be ready for that right but those who plan on that and that's their number one base case that this all comes down in the next six months i think that's just wrong my prediction is there will be moments of time over the next four five six ten years where it will look like the us is doing really well and then there will be moments of time where it looks like the rest of the world has the upper hand and then it will go back and forth and china will do something oh my god they landed somebody on the moon and now they're the sending power and then something bad will happen and their housing market gets worse and you know okay now they're now they're on the downturn but you know it's i just don't think we're going to get a resolution to this in the next six months i think this is a really big deal it's kind of hard to put into words how big of a deal this is because it's a big deal i think it's going to take a long time to fully play out

**Speaker 1:** and i'm sorry i just want to make sure i understand when you say this is a big deal what do you mean by this specifically

**Speaker 0:** basically the paragraph or the paragraphs that you read at the very beginning from our recent piece on the macro algorithm

**Speaker 1:** i'm sorry it the transition that trump has just set off here is that this or is this just the game of thrones that goes on geopolitically

**Speaker 0:** well i think it's a combination of the two we may get some resolution to what trump is doing with tariffs in the next six to twelve months but i don't think we're going to get a resolution of the geopolitical chessboard and america's role in it in the next six to twelve months

**Speaker 1:** okay great i'm glad for that clarification and that's what i thought you meant but i just wanted to clarify that for folks i agree and you know another framework that often gets mentioned on this channel by many of the experts i interview is the fourth turning and by the way folks i got neil howe coming back on the channel in a week or two i'll i'll check while brent's talking and give you the exact time but he's coming back on soon but kind of to your point brent i think a lot of people think oh we're in a fourth turning and you know when it ends that's when everything is going to be on fire and there's going be ashes left right and it's like no no like we we america has been through several fourth turnings right they are periods of upheaval but then there's a new order that arises from them then the cycle starts again then you know so to your point you know however this resolves in the relatively near term let's say next decade you know it will be replaced by something that will have additional ups and downs and a new system that'll get constructed and then get sclerotic and then get replaced again in eighty years so don't be so incredibly binary in your thinking of like america is here today and has some troubles therefore it must disappear tomorrow

**Speaker 0:** yeah and i think again just be brutally honest with yourself look around the world you have to invest for the next three to five years and you have to pick a region where do you put your money would you send your money to china right now would you send your money to europe right now knowing what europe has to deal with would you send your money to brazil and argentina for the next five years would you send it to africa would you send it to india now maybe the answer is yes or maybe a small portion of it is yes but the point is the money has to go somewhere and are you really so convinced that the us is on its last legs that you are willing to lock up your capital overseas in some other market for the next three to five years if the answer is not 100% yes then you have to look at the us because that's the only place left

**Speaker 1:** right and for an individual who's listening saying well brent i think this part of the world really is going be better i'm going put my money there fine as an individual you can do whatever you can the question you have to ask yourself is what do you think everybody else is going to think because it's where the capital flows go that determines how markets are going to perform

**Speaker 0:** that's right and we're getting into a time where and this kind of happened a little bit after covid it happened a little bit after the global financial crisis but where investors are not going to be as free to choose as they have been in the time period i've been growing up political decisions are going to be made about your capital that's just reality you are going to be barred from doing certain things you are going to be mandated to do certain things and certain individuals or companies who may say you know what i would really like i do think china is going to be the best in five years i would like to allocate my capital there but you might not be allowed to do it you might be mandated to do something you don't want to do and that's the type of environment that we are moving into we're starting what's it already exists a little bit but i think that is going to happen even more so

**Speaker 1:** and just to be clear this is what michael ebery has been predicting for a long time that this is what mercantilism is as you feed parts of your economy and you may starve parts of your economy and it's the free markets that were the unfettered free markets that we're so used to both inside our countries and around the world in the globalist environment that doesn't nearly apply as much in a mercantilist world because you have these national priorities that are put above just pure economics right yeah okay look brent this has been great we went a bit we've gone a bit far afield from from the points i wanted to get to but it it's all been great let let me let me try to wrestle this back in the remaining time we have left just to put a bow on china in your eyes what does a post settlement relationship with china look like so if if trump is successful in quote unquote kind of bringing china to heal or or or putting it in whatever box or you know getting china to a degree to whatever trade commitments he wants it to agree to what does that look like

**Speaker 0:** that's a great question this is just pure conjecture my guess is that we will still trade with china and we will still

**Speaker 1:** trade with oh i'm sure we'd have to yeah i don't think that's true

**Speaker 0:** but i do think the world is going to go from being one big economy and globalisation to more regionalised alliances and more regionalised economies china would most likely be the head of its region right maybe germany is the leader of europe maybe because they've got incredible problems as well and then i think the us would be the head of the western hemisphere so to speak i think there will be more trade intra region maybe than there will be between regions but i still think trade will take place between regions but i just think we're moving away not just because trump wants to do it from a geopolitical perspective but i think the local demographic and politics demand it as well think a lot of people think that all of this crisis that we're having now i don't even think it's a crisis yet but a lot of people are calling it a crisis is all because of trump and tariffs but i think to blame everything on trump and tariffs is to misunderstand the environment completely trump wouldn't even be in the white house if the crisis had not yet started in other words for somebody like trump to get elected on a populist platform there had to already be a large group of people in crisis to some extent or another that is why he is in the white house it's just that now it's becoming more of a front page crisis because wall street's feeling it rather than main street and going back to what we were saying at the very beginning success might not be measured by the stock market going back to all time highs i'm sure they would love that i'm sure they're going to do things to try to make that happen but i honestly don't think that's their number one goal i think they know that they need to change some things both for the way they work with the rest of the world and for the us internally i think they know that we couldn't continue down the same path without causing even internal strife and internal suffering this is just listen this is the hand we're dealt and this is what we have to deal with you know let's just get after it and stop worrying and stop complaining about it

**Speaker 1:** alright i'd love to keep digging into this sort of regional trading blocks i've had a lot of people talk about how they they do think trump sort of has a modern monroe doctrine view of the world which actually you can you can argue it makes a lot of sense right which is hey let's disentangle

**Speaker 0:** our thoughts it's so obvious anybody who denies this is just denying reality this is this is clearly what he's doing

**Speaker 1:** yeah well and there's a lot of attractiveness to it right which is we we disentangle from a lot of things that we've been spending a lot of money on and and maybe getting military involved in that hasn't really been working that much for us except perhaps for the military industrial complex but if we you know look in our hemisphere which is you know naturally protected from everybody else by two massive oceans there's a lot of opportunity to trade within it there's still a lot of you know emergent opportunity to tap in there we all like each other more or less in this in this hemisphere we can protect it you know trump's talked about the golden dome we bring greenland in more actively you know whether it's annexed or just a very tighter relationship we work out with canada how we're going to help you know even though we've irritated them in the short term we'll make nice and we'll you know strike tons of deals that will let us then get more militarily involved in the arctic so that we're preserving our national security as well as taking advantage of the minerals that are becoming increasingly available there so there is kind of this nice argument to be made that hey for the next couple decades if america just kind of focuses on close to home it can do great and rest of the world whatever right

**Speaker 0:** yeah and i think that is largely the plan

**Speaker 1:** yeah okay then that's what i wanted to ask for you okay we'll leave it there maybe we dig into that in a later date because it's a very interesting topic last sort of set of questions for you you're the dollar milkshake guy know i mentioned in the intro that the dollar was weakening that gold was soaring so if we can let's just get your outlook on those two things for the next quarter or two from here do you expect the dollar to continue its slide here or do you see a different destiny for it and then i'll ask you about gold

**Speaker 0:** so i don't think so listen the dollar has had a huge move down and of course this has brought out the usual suspects saying see it really is different this time now i'm not going to sit here and say the dollar hasn't gone down a lot it has got it went down 5% over a two week period what's really interesting and some people say this is proof it's different this time but the fact is this has happened a couple of other times and the reason that this has happened is because of the design of the monetary system i could give a very long answer but i'm going to give a pretty quick one the other two times that i can easily point to that this happened was in february and february of twenty twenty i don't know if you remember what happened in february or march of twenty twenty but it wasn't pretty i remember both does that mean that this is going to happen in may of twenty twenty five i don't know maybe not maybe so but the point is the reason the dollar is falling and the reason us asset prices have been falling is because the us has sucked up all of the world's capital over the last several years that is the dollar milkshake all the capital flows in the united states so when you get into a scary time a time of uncertainty time that you're not really sure what comes next what do you do you have to and their local markets were going down as well you must remember china's markets fell hong kong's markets fell europe's markets fell canada's markets fell in april this was not just a united states thing when that happens what do you do you sell your assets and you repatriate them home to deal with the problems that you're having in your local economy so how does that work well sell us dollar stocks or bonds they get dollars in exchange and then to send them home they exchange them to euros or pounds or whatever it is and they send them home and so as a result us asset prices fall and the us dollar falls that same thing happened in 02/2008 and in 2020 but then if it continues to get a lot worse and we go into a real crisis a real liquidity crisis that's when both times the dollar rebounded very quickly and went up very quickly and that's the same thing i would expect to happen again if we have more downside hard sharp and severe downside in global markets i would expect the us dollar to start making a rise higher as that global liquidity starts to trump the local liquidity needs so i can't sit here and say that the dollar won't go lower but if it does i don't think we're going to go into an environment where the us assets continue to fall the us dollar continues to fall but asset prices and currencies rise in europe and asia that just does not make any sense to me could it happen if that happens i'll have to reassess and figure out what to do that's not my expectation i think a lot of that is the reason that gold has been rising gold has been rising because we are entering this period of sovereign debt potentially a sovereign debt crisis potentially a us debt crisis and a sovereign debt crisis and a us debt crisis that was the initial impetus for the whole dollar milkshake to begin with as i thought we would go into a sovereign debt crisis the world would go into a sovereign debt crisis i thought interest rates would rise i thought treasury prices would fall so that never really happened to a big degree over the last five years but potentially that's what we're going into now but gold i feel like just had a big blow off top it had a huge run up it's pulled back my guess if i had to really guess we'll probably in the next week go back up and retest those highs and then probably pull back for a couple months now i can already hear people saying to see brent's bearish gold and the thing is everybody should own gold if you don't own any gold you should definitely go buy some gold but if you already own a bunch of gold then heck you have made a lot of money on it over the last couple years it's not a bad idea to hedge a little bit of it take a little bit of it off the table i will say if you zoom out and look at a chart of gold the last two times what just happened happened the following years were not great now this is not predicting that gold's going to go to $1,000 and stay in there i'm not saying that i'm just saying it's had a really good run it served its purpose my guess is that it's probably topping right now maybe it pulls back for a couple months maybe you have a chance to buy it at a little bit better price over the summer to be clear i'm not selling my gold i'm not recommending anybody sell their gold i'm just saying i think it's up like 25% or 30% for the year already i don't think we're going to $10,000 gold today and the dollar is going to end up in the trash bin i just think that that's not realistic

**Speaker 1:** okay alright and then how about the markets in general for this year i guess because sounds you still feel like it's going be a 2022 type of environment so i guess that means that the beatings will continue through fall

**Speaker 0:** well think so i think the analog is really good because between january 1 and september 30 or the october in 2022 the market fell and p the nasdaq was down more than this the s and p went down 25% but along the way there was two rallies of 6% there was one rally of 11% and there was a fourth rally of 17% so now we've seen the market went down like 15% we've had a rally of 5% wouldn't shock me at all if we have i think we'll probably go down we'll probably retest those lows maybe even go a little bit lower but then we'll probably have a hard rally but my guess is that it's going to be later in the year q3 q4 before we find any kind of solid bottom if we find one

**Speaker 1:** okay and just to let you know you're in pretty good company with recent guests on this channel including felix zuloff he thinks it's going to be you know fairly choppy through fall he recommends specifically selling the rips and you know nibbling in on the dips if you want to but he is basically saying keep your powder dry that's the big priority right now he does think and again i've invited him to come back on later in the year to make an audible call if things change when he has more more data but he thinks in the fall we will hit a bottom and that'll really be the time to really start going pretty pretty aggressively long because he thinks '26 and '27 are going to be pretty good years in the market i don't know if

**Speaker 0:** you're comfortable talking that i that's very possible that follows the analog for 2022 because 2022 there was a lot of uncertainty a lot of volatility the market went down a lot everybody thought that was the end and then we had two years of a pretty strong bull market i could easily see that same thing play out again

**Speaker 1:** okay all right well let me ask you this just to wrap this up how are you investing right now looking at the next quarter or two are you just sort of sticking with the assets you've normally told me that you own with the normal allocations or are you making any adjustments to focus or allocation given your current read

**Speaker 0:** no so we we've been very fortunate so we had a pretty tough december because all again remember at the beginning i anybody who hasn't been paying that wasn't ready for what trump's doing just wasn't paying attention i thought that everything that started happening in january would start happening in december i thought we would get a bounce out of the election just on the euphoria of trump coming in and the belief that the positive business aspirations but i thought once they started to figure out what his policies actually were the markets would sell down so we started adding hedges in december and it went against us pretty hard that was kind of a rough christmas but they started to pay off pretty well in january february and march so we're in good shape right now and so we're kind of ahead of the game we have dramatically reduced our hedges couple of weeks ago we still have a couple of little ones and we've started to put them back on my guess is that within the next week we'll have a lot more of them again because i do think that we're going to see further downside we'll keep our allocation to gold even though i think gold is due to pull back we'll keep our allocation because that's a strategic allocation that we don't trade we may do some gold hedges whether it's puts or whatever it is at some point i still think that interest rates probably go sideways to higher all of our fixed income exposure is very short term mostly t bills maybe a few that go out two or three years but really no duration at all and i think we still have exposure to us equities again they were hedged for the first part of the year that worked out pretty

**Speaker 1:** is it just hedged or are you reducing any of your

**Speaker 0:** no no right now it's hedged but we're not net short now we were net short back in february and march and that worked out pretty well but now we're pretty much just kind of flat

**Speaker 1:** okay but i'm making this up can correct me if normally your portfolio is 40% allocated to equities are you protecting it just by hedging that 40% or are you bringing that 40% down to say 30% as well

**Speaker 0:** oh no no we've actually been we we have actually used this dip to actually start buying so for people who are underweight equities you're adding back we're to add back with the i'm not predicting that we bought at the very bottom we think there's going to be further downside but everything got so oversold two weeks ago that typically things don't get more oversold than that and so that would to me that was a pretty obvious case that we're gonna at least get a relief sideways move if not a little bit of a bump and think we've just bumped 5% four % five % so we haven't had a huge rally but we're certainly not seeing the crazy volatility and fear that we saw two weeks ago but i think it's very possible that we do again before the next three or four or five months maybe in the next couple of weeks wouldn't surprise me in the next couple of weeks

**Speaker 0:** i think the best advice i can give is try to keep an open mind don't get too tied to one school of thought or one way of thinking about things i try my best to kind of listen to everybody and see everybody's point of view then as i mentioned earlier try to take your personal wants and desires out of your analysis and just figure out what's most likely to happen i think if you do that and kind of think for yourself you're probably going to be ahead of most of the people that are just kind of chasing the headlines
