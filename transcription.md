**Jordi Visser:** back for another week and this week there's gonna be a a theme that i'm gonna kinda try to do at the very beginning because there's been a lot of observations i've had at at dinners over the past week i had a dinner with just macro people market people from wall street i had one where it was about half macro half crypto and then i had another one that was pretty much all crypto and i'll get to why that's important but i wanna give you the observations we'll talk about the reason that this is important which is i've said before i'll say it again it's the end of the world as we know it and people need to adapt they need to adjust it's been going on for some time i'm gonna give a little bit of a history lesson here and hopefully by the end of this you'll get a sense as to how this has been happening and thinking in a binary right way right now is is is gonna get you hurt in terms of the investment side another week that felt like a year trump uses the bazooka the liquidity bazooka which people now learn doesn't have to be money if you've created the problem then all you have to do is pretend like the problem is solved and it scares the hell out of people so there's not much trading volumes are light and we're we've bounced up significantly so you've killed everyone who got bearish and said it was the end of the world the people who are bullish i'm sure at some point soon they'll feel something on the downside as well so we'll go through that the white house got scared this week bear market rally crowd is not gonna leave anytime soon hard data is about to fall hard and why that's obvious bear market for approval ratings and investing for the new world so first thing i wanna do is go back to my time in brazil and just show you one of my favorite trips that i took i spent the week in the amazon while i was in brazil in the nineties and this was one of the coolest times taking a boat and going over where the rio negro and the rio thalamois meet and how it's not binary in markets but this is the way people are basically acting and we don't have one system that is going to fall apart so the thing i want people to think about it's the end of the world as we know it but you don't just go from one side of the river to the other and have this dramatic shift the rivers meet at some point and the systems run parallel like this but eventually they turn into the amazon and it's one colored river so we're not at the point of two separate systems these systems meaning the old monetary system and the new one that's coming they've been merging together for some time so to get people to believe that because i'm literally sick of dealing with macro people who say bitcoin is worthless and say they have nothing to do with it this is not a bitcoin episode this is a digital economy versus industrial so i wanna first give everyone a quote that alan toffler is famous for and i'll just bring this down here so that people can see it the illiterate of the twenty first century so now will not be those who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn unlearn and relearn that's the message of this week which is going out to dinners and listening to people have binary hardened ways they're bearish all the time they think gold is gonna somehow another be used in starbucks all of these people that you hear that you you see on x basically they're not worth listening to because they're never gonna change their mind so how do you learn anything if you're not going to in the twenty first century where you have access to ai at your fingertips where you can learn more unlearn and relearn i wrote a paper called the art of unlearning back in 02/2016 and again this was at a time when i was fixated on how the digital economy was destroying the concept of of recessions destroying the concept of gdp as as a whole and how we would eventually as as we got to exponential innovation hit what alan toffler was writing about in the third wave third wave a post industrial era driven by information decentralization and customization the new phase would dismantle mass production models transform institutions like education and government lead to a society centered around technology digital communication and flexible knowledge based economies toffler saw this shift not just as technological but deeply cultural and political warning that the resistance from the second wave the second wave the industrial revolution the people you hear talk about things like the global reserve currency and all this stuff that was created during the industrial revolution they would cause turbulence and societies adapted to the decentralized fast changing third wave world this was written the book the third wave in 1980 so this is only four years after the personal for personal computer and it's a decade before the internet so again if you wanna spend time learning on the macro side and actually see what the third wave is and what the new information agent means means i would suggest going and spend time with alan toffler first thing hear a lot about gold right now here's gold since the great or since 02/2007 before the great financial crisis this is it versus the s and p so it finally took over this is all normalized so now gold has outperformed the fiat the best fiat asset you have msci world ex the us in here and you have the barclays ag so basically every fiat currency every fiat asset now has gone and this is why people see what's happening the fiat system the current system is breaking down and we're going back to in people's minds where we were before so to give you the history of the first fiat system to not be gold backed so this is where when you hear people talk about it this is the learning lesson of just making sure that everyone who reads the paper and goes through this we're heading back we need to have gold everyone's racing for gold that was the last system we were under we had a global reserve currency we had the dollar from the forties into 1971 we had the british pound before that they were all backed by gold and that brought trust into the system we broke away from that in 1971 and we created a new system completely new experiment and that new experiment was to try and just have a fiat currency which again the fact that people now view it as something they can trust they can't trust bitcoin but they can trust a paper thing that's not backed by gold well that switched in 1971 the system ran into trouble 1985 we had the plaza accord in 1997 '90 '8 i was in brazil we had the asian financial crisis the asian financial crisis led to all asian countries realizing they needed more dollar reserves they needed dollar reserves so think of that as gold because they never wanted to be in the situation again that they could be basically caused to go down by hedge funds they started exporting more and bringing in dollars and that's why we are in this situation that we're in this fiat system led to them going we're gonna hoard dollars and we're just gonna export we're not gonna focus on consumption because we never wanna be in a position again where we have this problem that leads to 02/2008 because they're buying all the bonds in the us they're just buying and buying buying dollars anything outside of their countries is keeping rates at lower levels no matter what's happening in the us you can just continue to issue mortgages and they'll buy them so we get the great financial crisis we get the printing press the printing press leads to a tremendous amount of debt we get 2020 we get more debt we get silicon valley bank the fastest bank run-in us history 42,000,000,000 in deposits withdrawn in a single day so now where are we we've got a hundred trillion dollars of global debt over 60% of it dominated in dollars and 40% of that debt matures before the end of twenty twenty seven so the system is basically breaking down and what has happened historically is you end up with a depression defaults war revolution and that's why macro people are bearish and you go back to the gold standard that's not happening this time us looks more like an emerging market every day so again you're starting to see where stocks bonds and and currencies are doing things they've never done before the end of the global reserve currency with the dollar as it is there it's not coming back ever again because it was only there since 1971 and trust has been broken this was an article in the feet this week basically saying that the financial market has become increasingly dependent on hedge funds employing high leverage strategies basis trades to prevent liquidity and support daily volumes the bond market is over in terms of people trusting the us treasury market that is not coming back at the size of the debt you can't go through it hedge funds are in there and then we've got this being written by the guy who's been who wrote a paper about what we're going through now with the tariffs he also wrote one on the mar a lago accord and just so people realize basically saying that the us has to restructure the debt also known as a default so why would you trust the dollar ever again if you are china if you're an asian country for the allies that we had the way that they handled the the tariffs there's no trust that's coming back so the system as far as the dollar being the element of trust that everyone jumps into it's not coming back again at the same time that this was going on i wanna go back to alan toffler the digital economy has been growing and it's been dominating the world since 1990 in terms of asset price moves it's why the us it's not the death of exceptionalism us dominated technology this did not start in the last fifteen years the internet was the birth of the us outperforming the rest of the globe just go look at what the s and p five hundred has done versus msci world ex the us in local terms since 1990 this has been a us dominated asset move since the '19 nineties but in 1975 personal computer comes out 1991 the birth of the internet 02/2007 the smartphone era comes 02/2008 the bitcoin white paper comes during lack of trust in the banking system globally 02/2008 we launched the app store 02/2010 the cloud takes over 02/2022 openai releases chatgpt in '25 the us congress passes the stablecoin act providing the first clear regulatory framework for dollar backed digital assets that's what's coming on right now with stablecoins so the reason i'm going through this in terms of this the digital economy and bitcoin did not just happen this has been going on now for some time for macro people that say it's worthless i'll take marc andreessen over day on everyone who hasn't spent the time to go listen to anything on it so why bitcoin matters by marc andreessen political idolist project visions of liberation revolution onto it establishment elites heap contempt and scorn on it so this has been going on since the beginning eventually mainstream products companies and industries emerge to commercialize it it becomes profound and later many people wonder why it's promise was more obvious from the start what technology am i talking about personal computers the internet no i'm talking about bitcoin this is marc andreessen in 02/2014 about four months later he had this interview in this article in the washington post in 02/2014 he said in twenty years so we're now eleven years from that interview we'll talk about bitcoin like we talk about the internet today again i'm bringing this up because this has been happening that river that you saw we are about to merge the two systems they've been running parallel just like what you saw with the two sides the assets and the way to make money has all been on the digital economy it has not been on the industrial economy we know that if you go look at the price of ford and you go look at the price of gm and you look at the price of ge going all the way back to 02/2007 you see what has happened it's all been about technology and software and everything that has been dominated as us exceptionalism it's really been the digital economy so congress moves forwards on stablecoin legislation the digital asset teabag presentation that i've referenced many many times so again the governments are sitting there moving it towards stablecoins so they're moving towards another system the treasury sat there and had this is before trump took over in terms of the teabag presentation different types of stablecoins fiat backed ones so think about going from gold gold standard to fiat then fiat by itself and now we're talking about fiat backed digital economy stablecoins so this is what's happening there's no turning back it's being supported this is from chris sticks and recently the internet made information free and global so why is it still hard and expensive to move money you cannot walk into starbucks and go pay with gold you cannot move into go into starbucks in new york city and go hand them euros and get coffee what you can do is go in there with your phone and pay with stablecoins you can go in there and pay with a card you can take your bitcoin transfer it into stablecoins transfer it into your card you can already do that so anyone that says you can't use the money go try to pay with your s and p 500 spiders go try to do this the system is changing and it can already happen stablecoins are whatsapp moment for money transfers says a 16 z this is two weeks ago i've said on this for the entire year beginning after stripe purchased bridge that this is the beginning of the network effects from stablecoins into bitcoin and into everything that goes on in the digital ecosystem china may shift from us treasuries towards gold bitcoin blackrock says digital yuan goes global this was a tweet or a post in x this week basically talking about there's been no confirmation that this happened but you have to read through the article and go see everything that went on the chinese are trying to get off the dollar as fast as possible and they're trying to lead the way the same way the us is on the payment system china rolls out plan to promote its own payment system as us trade war simmers china hasn't devalued i've talked about this repeatedly we're past the point of using the old method if it was if china was being under attack for tariffs why aren't they devaluing well they can't devalue it doesn't really matter at this point but in terms of like going floating in currency in the global financial system now dominated by the us means making a country's financial system more exposed to us actions so this is the whole thing is that the us decided in 2022 to do something with the dollar as the global reserve currency they weaponized it and immediately after that as i showed in last week in february of twenty two russia we basically sanctioned them and every dollar asset they held was frozen in china's case they immediately said okay we have to go start buying more gold and their gold purchases started going through the roof and their treasury sales accelerated so this wasn't something that just happened this has been building up for some time and remember the russian sanctions were not a russia thing this this has been or not a trump thing this was a biden thing this has been kind of the route that we've gone it doesn't matter which side it's the us and china it's not just donald trump so the dollar this year it's it's falling and everyone's talking about how it's collapsing and going through it you can see that every currency in the world it's going down against than the majors but guess what here it is here are the currencies versus the yuan the yuan has fallen as much as the dollar because it's unchanged versus dollar because the two biggest countries in the world have a peg currency and there's no way the chinese yuan becomes the reserve currency so again the world is looking for a solution to this problem it's not just the us that has a deficit with china europe has a trade deficit with china that's been permanent as well so the system needs to be reset it needs to be changed and every single person that continues to say that they've been saying that this is a scam this is a bubble this will end as worthless and it's not just people that i go to dinner with it is warren buffett it was charlie munger it is jamie dimon they're all still saying the same thing and yet at the end of this year it will be the second biggest asset in the world behind gold this is where the economy is going that's the end of that part when you're seeing stuff like this this is three weeks in a row with the economist ruination day the age of chaos how a dollar crisis would unfold again it's the end of the global reserve currency you cannot go back the bearish sentiment on how this is gonna end we're in the early stage of a bank run-in the us this is all bs it's not that people aren't gonna move money out of the dollar but again you have to take the assets and you have to put them somewhere else you have to invest in something and yes the ones that are attached to the government the ones the government can move they will put them in something but if european stocks go down for the next five years and us stocks go up for the next five years sorry they will move money back in so this is it's great that everyone's saying there's repatriation the dollar weakening makes complete sense but where you're gonna put that money in terms of assets that's something that's very different so i'm gonna put this up again as i go into the next thing you're gonna see this three times you must learn unlearn and relearn at this point because the system has changed and if you're not comfortable with the new system that's fine this gets into the binary nature of everyone so here's the s and p i showed this after the fall when i got when i wrote a piece about the low most likely being in or at least that was the point where i thought we'd start to see the risk reward shift dramatically and the administration need to respond so that range there is still what i believe meaning here we are at around forty nine fifth 4,900 here we are up here at 5,700 it's not binary anymore we're in the midpoint we already made back over 50% of the fall from the breakdown this is where we are currently we actually got back where every sale made this is the opening price after liberation day every sale made on the indices in most stocks is now a losing sale so if you sold after the liberation day with all the tariffs and the fact that the tariffs are still on there's just a pause on some of them but china's one is bigger so we still have the largest tariff since the great depression and yet stocks have found a way to go higher how is that possible bullish and bearish i i'm sick of this as well everyone who's bullish and everyone who's bearish that's not what this is if you're gonna make money for the next six months my gut tells me you're gonna have to trade the market you're gonna have to be bearish for weeks and then you're gonna have to be bullish for weeks so saying this is a bear market rally or saying it's a a buy the dip bull market i don't think either is right i think we're the tariffs and the situation you cannot go backwards so there is gonna be massive change that's happening i just think the thing that it should do is it should keep the multiple outside so if right now what we've done is a reset in terms of positioning for asset allocators hedge funds have not reset they're still very bearish and they have to make money they have to do something before the end of the year as a reminder this is when i put this thing out on april 8 the light at the end of the turbulence and within there what i said is that number one it ranks as the fourth largest two day decline in the s and p and i go through the fact that in each of those prior instances the market was higher three and six months later and we're headed to that path and i think that's gonna happen but what needed to happen is in each of those cases we got assistance from the federal government not the case now but given this is self inflicted a let's just say a pivot is needed invest at getting more involved to me looks like that pivot that's what i wrote about that's clearly what's happened you can't even find peter navarro and howard lutnick at this point they're not involved in it you don't see them anymore and i don't think you're gonna see them anymore second derivative of policy i've said at 22 v in our meetings but i've also said it on on these things just so people get it because people have asked second derivative is just the rate of change so if everything is bad but it's less bad that's good for markets because markets lead and so they're looking for things that's less bad now rate of change could get better for a little while and get worse i don't think that's gonna happen i'm gonna go through why but right now it's being driven by a change this will mark the lows in my opinion and the reason i thought this is one of the dumbest things i've seen when howard luckman got on tv on sunday about the the the trade war and said the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iphones are coming to the us that was pretty much when stupidity had reached its high and things needed to change and that's when as i said navarro and ludnick you're in the back seat bessen you're in the front seat let's figure out a way to to keep our tariffs but also not have the market collapse and everything fall apart charlie gasparino put it best at the end of this week the white house is playing a spin game with trade seeing how talks of progress move stocks you know donald trump loves this and this is what i said he can just say anything and get a rally it won't last forever there needs to be deals but i'm sure there will be deals because they realize you can't do this forever so they're gonna be deals and when we get a deal the market will go up but since we've already had a rally i don't think it's gonna follow through other than short covering but again as the longer this goes on this game and the more that china and the us ease their situation people will start looking past all the stuff that's gonna be coming for the next two weeks which is a lot of bad information on on the economy some bad information on earnings but since companies aren't giving guidance everyone's gonna start looking forward to what's happening after the summertime we'll assume we'll have something set there monday so that was just a kind of a what's been in the papers now to monday monday was another panic day so you had trump threats to fire the fed chair so everything was horrible he blamed he's gonna blame powell for any downturn so the market's down big we head down to the lows trump warns the economy may slow if fed doesn't cut rates and of course marking the lows again cnbc has a market in turmoil when you see this come on your screen you buy the close every time trump calls ceo brian cornell's meeting with trump about tariffs productive so monday while the market is falling target walmart home depot they're at the white house it's it's very productive ceos of walmart flat out told trump prices will go up and shelves will be empty leaders of six automotive associations wrote a letter basically saying we're already in trouble many are in distress they'll face stoppages layoffs bankruptcies if one supplier is disrupted could lead to a shutdown of the entire the the intelligence of the tariffs without the without a lot of research on what would happen is starting to be coming so what happens the next day besson expects tariff standoff with china to deescalate this was at a dinner and eamon javers is kind of important but can we rebalance together they have stifled the consumer economy favoring retracting the identity of it would be less consumption for china somehow i could see a ray dalio essay on this like a big beautiful rebalancing i've been talking about the the hope they had of a beautiful rebalancing which they're now saying is what they want the goal is not a hard break we want us to engage but it's gotta be more fair the way they handled this was just ridiculous but they want to do something with china the problem is white house considers slashing china tariffs to de escalate the trade war so this whole thing goes on and part of the reason is if you look i think i saw a number that container bookings between china and the us and this is from two weeks ago is down 64% so the goal isn't to decouple the goal isn't to decouple again they're starting to worry because they're realizing that the economy is going to weaken so they say there's talks going on china says there's no talks going on so this is the way the week ends no one knows who to believe anything this is insanity but it's ridiculous but it is why the system is ending because you're never gonna get people to trust after this kind of chaos the bearish sentiment has not changed at all we are still at record highs and we've been sitting up here since march so liquidation you know liberation day is in here sentiment has been negative for a long time whenever you have negative sentiment for a long time you would expect it to start going higher here's the long short from goldman in terms of their leverage so gross leverage is still up they hedged up their books but net leverage is down and the long short ratio is down so on the hedge fund side have it on the systematic strategies they're basically at the lowest level they can be so as things move higher and as vol comes down you'll start seeing things like there's 50,000,000 to buy in a flat tape just because as the market goes higher all the selling that happened there hasn't been any buying so one of the things that's happened and been a theme over the past really decade has been that markets go down there's a panic and then volume just stops and you know who keeps buying buybacks and this other group that everyone says is really stupid retail retail's been buying every dip for the last decade they continue to put it in and every macro person says i'm not gonna get long until retail has capitulated retail doesn't have withdrawals this is a rigged market the government comes in and does what trump is doing why wouldn't you be buying every time there's a big sell off of 20% because that seems to be the line in the sand as to where they're handing out free money and people wanna be philosophical and ideological about the views they've had for the last fifteen years they need to learn they need to unlearn and they need to stop with the side of saying they're not gonna relearn anything so there was a thrust signal this week i've shown these all the time another one that's gone up so it's not just been the sentiment we're actually seeing days that are very very severe on the upside the down days they get reversed now very quickly the opposite of what was happening before economist what a shock coinflip do what you want with that the market's already priced that in the vix remember we got up to 60 and everyone was like you're gonna have a recession we've had these we've had these now we've gone all the way back to '24 and during that entire period there's been no layoffs i've talked about this before the job situation completely different than the prior ones so every time we had these spikes before the jobless claims never went higher because the job market has completely changed because of the digital economy again people work from home contingent workforce makes up 30 to 40% of the labor market this includes consultants this includes doordash drivers this includes uber drivers if you lose your job the reason you don't have to be on unemployment is because anyone can go out and be an uber driver anyone can go out and be a doordash again the economy has changed rapidly most of the jobs being created are health care and education which are not cyclical plus you have this thing that they can't be fired by our company because they don't work for them adapt adapt here's year over year s and p so again we got down here and i said if we have a recession we can do this but this was a great financial crisis this is when we had the birth of the printing press and the birth of the iphone this is when the digital economy became more of it this is when we shut an economy down and people are still able to spend at home do you realize that if we shut had a pandemic here and we shut everything down there was no amazon back then so there was no delivery of this you could get books but you couldn't get all the things that you need because the app store wasn't born until you got into here so the economy's changed digital economy's been coming up but people are still looking at this stuff telling the same story that they've told over and over it is boring to listen to macro guys it is boring to hear how bearish people get and how this is the end of the world and you can only buy gold it is bearish it is just a bore show to sit at a dinner table and listen to it alright ryan peterson this is the bad news that's coming if you haven't read this yet i don't know what you're missing this is the beauty of the information age is every single thing is known so yes we have no ships coming in yes they're not going to the ports yes the soft data is still horrible no one's doing anything people are canceling air flights they're all down the national economy in beige book largely unchanged that's basically the same as saying there's a soft recession employment was mostly flat same thing as saying it's a soft recession we have inflation still anyone saying we're not gonna have inflation i showed last week we're gonna have inflation it's not gonna last necessarily forever but for the next three months if we're not gonna have anything coming in and we're gonna have empty shelves the prices are gonna go higher you're ahead inflation expectations this is the atlanta fed going higher you've got other ones here the red one here is umich this one is politically bastardized so it doesn't really matter but then you've got the new york fed you've got the conference board we've got growth slowing we have inflation going down the fed won't be able to cut rates bank we still don't have liquidity deals aren't getting done all of this at this point is no news all of it here is what people may not know three new polls were just released this is from friday and they're absolutely horrific the only one i really care about is the fox news poll i'll leave all these out so here you got the fox news one i mean he's losing on everything the economy 38% approved donald trump has a base of 40% he he's actually lost 22% of the people two he's lost 22% in in his the tariffs so at this point i i don't know how the midterms are gonna go next year so here's what the reality is now we're gonna shift into how you make money coming out of this because if we go sideways for the next five years it would not surprise me i would not be surprised if five years from now that's the way we burn off this because as i've said i believe ai is a completely disruptive force that also is gonna impact where the multiple should be in the market particularly in tech multiples ai will disrupt all companies every single one of them and it's 50% tech so ai to me is there so i've never been positive on stocks i don't care i think we could be unchanged i don't own any really except for one and then a little bit of something on the the embodiment side but google came out and said they're still gonna meet their capex target how bad could things be if google is saying they're gonna still put in the 75,000,000,000 so what do we get sox over the ndx is what i want everyone to start focusing on because when we've had earnings revisions and again this is the earnings revision factor which gets really important to people being able to take risk this thing needs to go higher if this goes higher historically it's happened because the stocks has outperformed the nasdaq and this is going back to 02/2012 so i'd be watching the semis you've got dram memory that is expected to get a lot more expensive part of that is from the tariffs but again it's demand they're out in many cases so the demand side even in this is gonna happen because ai is a is a theme that is going to go on beth kindig who's awesome taiwan semi is said to be implementing over 30% hike as demand continues to outstrip supply you wanna focus on areas where demand is outstripping supply okay this is the final part of this video but one more time you gotta learn you gotta unlearn what you think you know especially gold backed stuff and you gotta relearn so for the investment side let's get back into it a week after liberation day there was a hearing in washington titled converting energy into intelligence the future of ai technology human discovery and american global competitiveness it's four hours it's online you can go watch it eric schmidt spoke at it this was about the impact and the need for power so you don't have to go watch it if you don't want but 22 v research i did a 25 page report electrify and amplify how bits and bytes drive demand for watts and volts power power power you need to have your portfolio more weighted towards power going forward so i'm giving you the ideas in my mind that when when we come out of this from when people are investing you wanna go to the places that the government is supporting the government is going to make sure there's revenues going through they are doing things for financials in terms of deregulation they're doing things for health care because the entitlements will continue to give people money so the revenues are there then you want to see what ai is doing ai is driving power and the government knows that we need more power so that's what eric schmidt was there for in terms of the healthcare side and longevity side you had demis from deepmind the ceo basically said all disease will be cured in about ten years again this is not the industrial economy this is something where you have to pay attention to what's going on in technology eric schmidt had a youtube it was about twenty minutes ex google ceo warning ai will be smarter and uncontrollable he's giving an update on where we are with agi and asi and how it's going even faster at the very end in terms of the final five minutes he talked about an amazing thing in terms of the drug so it actually started yeah about five minutes in what's gonna happen in terms of allowing this so the project that he's involved in aims to identify all druggable human biological targets within two years which could revolutionize pharma development think of it as every single druggable human bi biological target so anything where drugs can work they will have solutions for and this again gets into how do you value what the market is the one thing i won't say is if anything the mark the stock market to me will go higher in the next five years but i could see it absolutely as being sideways because of the weightings and at least for certain in the us but i just wanna make sure that you understand that we are entering a period right now with technology where ai is accelerating so fast that i think people are getting caught worrying about the global reserve currency where i'm telling you there's already a plan in place to to resolve it what is an ai agent this is a mckinsey report that came out on march 25 highly recommend spending time on it the ai agents are here i wrote a paper on this ai agents are here again 22 v research spending time on health care what names and parts are there that you should be looking at and then my buddy anthony pompliano we do weekly podcast together on the bridge between macro and and and crypto for people trying to learn each week i would highly recommend spending time on it we talk about a lot of things going on but anthony had an interview with chris camillo who is heavily into humanoid robots as an investor and he talked about him on there he's been the best person i've heard give broad interviews it was great that that pomp had him on but he talked about it how do you value an infinite labor force and this gets into i don't know none of us know what it's gonna look like going forward but the question is how do you value it how do you even think about the fact that we're going back to the gold standard we're gonna have humanoids billions of them within twenty years so why in god's name would you think about what the world's gonna look like that isn't the digital economy when everything is gonna be run by artificial intelligence so to go back to the gold standard makes no sense whatsoever or to believe that gold is gonna be the best asset you wanna invest in things that are related to the system that's going to be here and what's gonna be dominating everything's gonna be about speed everything's gonna be about longevity everything's gonna be about artificial intelligence number one opportunity for humanoids guess where it's going healthcare it's where we need it the most and you know how we know that because we have a shortage that's why we we still are hiring 40 to 80,000 health care jobs a month very hard to get negative jobs when there's no manufacturing jobs already in the country which is why we're trying to bring manufacturing back and at the same time we have a shortage of health care because we have a problem with obesity and diabetes in the country and we have the government which is subsidizing it and they're going to continue to pay money which means they're going to continue to print money which means we're going to continue to have the government being a dominant part of the economy which means nominal gdp will stay up this is the most important arms race in decades so the thing about humanoids is they're part of this and believe it or not i didn't include this rare earths were shut down and banned from china they they process more than 90% of the raw earth material so if you wanna know one reason why there has to be a resolution to this for the people who don't think or like nope chinese are gonna invade and china basically runs our military to some degree because you can't have humanoids without rare earth material you can't have iphones you can't have fighter jets you can if you do it yourself but the problem is right now china has dominance so you'd have to wait four or five years in the us to get the manufacturing going so there is a linkage in terms of rare earth and they put a ban on that right after liberation day for those of you looking again i did i'm showing you the research that i've done on this this was another 20 page plus report on moving from software to embodied ai again the next phase of technology and where the investment's gonna be if we're gonna have 20,000,000,000 robots in twenty years you can make a lot of money and that was chris camilo's point he's made a lot of money in his life he's in one of the market wizard books and basically he would have said i've never seen an opportunity this bid sitting at this early a stage the question is how do you make the money on it i go through the places in the marketplace and the names in particular that i think will benefit now we're gonna get into the final part bitcoin alright here's bitcoin versus the s and p back to 02/2010 so i'm just highlighting to you that for everyone who's been bearish that you've ever read stop listening to the people who are bearish if you bought bitcoin and you sold the s and p you've made a ton of money if you bought bitcoin and sold the ndx you've made a ton of money if you bought bitcoin and sold gold you've made a ton of money except for this little point here and this is really the point where gold because central banks should be buying gold because buying bitcoin at this point is not something they do they will eventually here's bitcoin versus the mag seven this has been my theme for the entire year is that we're ai is disrupting the mag seven they're spending tons of money they're never gonna see the revenues come through they were the last place that individual investors that are wealthy could invest to get growth if the mag seven's dead everyone's gonna have to go find the next growth opportunity my my 90 year old stepfather got into bitcoin a while ago he's thankful he also owns gold i don't understand why people don't own gold and some bitcoin but i think the wealthy people will finally be coming because it will be working and as i said on a a podcast this week this will be like donald trump you can ask a hundred people who voted for donald trump you're not gonna get the answers of the people all said some people don't wanna say it by the end of this year people own bitcoin they'll never admit it if they've been bearish and it may already be there since liberation day bitcoin is now the best performing asset so gold gets all the press it's front page it's up every single day and yet since liberation day which was effectively the end of the global reserve currency we've got stocks down but they're almost back to unchanged this is both the mag seven and the s and p gold was working more than bitcoin but there was a change that happened which is why this is the focus for this week because i believe what has happened now is once the treasury market became an issue which is what happened in here then all of a sudden the trust factor was gone and the official beginning of the new monetary system was here and that's where bitcoin goes i'm bringing this up because if you haven't read this this is not just a donald trump thing people harvard has liabilities any investor that has liabilities needs returns you cannot get returns going forward in my opinion in the s and p 500 to necessarily beat inflation you cannot get them in bonds you cannot get them in any asset class of size i don't think you can get necessarily in private equity and i don't think you can get in private debt if he's gonna do these tariffs we are gonna see more bankruptcies we are gonna see more businesses go out and if you need to invest in something where are you gonna get excess returns not on the hedge fund side so where are you gonna get your excess returns where are you gonna get liquidity which is the issue here they're selling something which has no liquidity bitcoin you can trade a billion dollars you can be traded on sundays you can trade it on saturdays you can trade it at any time of the day twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five days a year that's the new monetary system guys that's where we're headed towards and then we had this so we've got the government again continuing to get involved it's not just donald trump that's kind of insider trading right now on bitcoin with his son tweeting about buying it him involved in trying to get it higher and now you've got cantor doing something with softbank and tether and bitfinex to basically set up a large let's say micro strategy type investment they'll be buying bitcoin you've obviously had other other companies doing it and the spac was up big on the back of it so again when it's working and people are doing it you're gonna get more people on very end more just there fed rolls back crypto warnings for wall street this happened on friday it's not a complete win but the banks are gonna be doing stuff on crypto a senator invest more in bitcoin wow he announces that he's bought more as he's working on the bill i wonder if bitcoin's actually already been decided as a reserve i listened to an interview with hamilton lane again on anthony pompliano who basically they're doing tokenized funds already you'll start to learn a lot more about tokenization the capital structure of the world is changing so not only is the global reserve currency changing you have stable coins you have bitcoin you have the blockchain and you have tokenization they are all lined up continue to try and learn guys about this because this is the way the world's gonna work in terms of making money apollo unveils tokenized private credit fund this will allow again individuals to buy private stuff even if it's only with $10 that's the beauty of having tokenization and china rolls out a hundred million dollar tokenized fund it's not just the us guys it's china as well as the rest of the world here's the final part believe it or not if you like gold the best performing asset of size related to this whole conversation micro strategy so everyone who's bearish on micro strategy every single person who's at these dinners basically says i know this is a scam because of michael saylor i'm a macro person i consider myself reasonably learned i've i've been trading macro for a long time i consider and talk history and and assets with anybody microstrategy was up over 300% the last two years gold was not it has now surpassed gold this year so in terms of gold being the biggest asset no but there's no no charts out there in microstrategy so the only person who seems to get what the new world is gonna look like who has a moat on the moat of currency and things going forward what i call bitcoin the s and p 500 of the future because of the disruption that is coming and the capital structure changing completely with no debt going forward and the capital structure will be different it'll be built around bitcoin and michael saylor basically has a moat on it and that's why there's a premium on his business i'm gonna finish it here if you guys wanna go learn this is one of the podcasts i listen to with michael saylor four hours and two minutes listen to alvin tommler go out learn unlearn relearn do anything just don't go to these dinners and be bearish have a good weekend guys see you next week
