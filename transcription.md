**Nicolai Tangen** hi everyone i'm nicola tangen the head of the norwegian sovereign wealth fund and today i'm in really good company with ken rogoff now ken is known for his insights into global finance economic history and for his incredible book which he wrote together with carmen reinhart which is like a seminal book actually and it's called this time it's different he's out with a new book coming up soon and you can look forward to it ken wonderful to have you here

**Kenneth Rogoff** wonderful to be here thank you for having me on your podcast

**Nicolai Tangen** so ken i think i've said once that discussing you know inflation with you that's a bit like discussing the bible with with jesus but i mean let's let's give it a go

**Kenneth Rogoff** i don't know how we can live up to that

**Nicolai Tangen** ken how would you assess the current state of the global economy just now

**Kenneth Rogoff** well it was in modestly good shape but obviously it's being thrown into chaos with the restructuring of globalization that donald trump comes with what's happening in europe you know it it's a pretty wild time i don't think it's it'd be a little bit much say it's unlike anything we've seen before i think it feels a little like the seventies to me trump actually feels a little like nixon to me but obviously we're in for a wild ride

**Nicolai Tangen** where are we in terms of american exceptionalism

**Kenneth Rogoff** now well it's been dented i mean i almost we we sometimes call the us the hegemon the one that dominates everything and it's almost like the hegemon is turning on itself and trump says and i hope he has a plan that it's all gonna be better on the other side of this but obviously the stock markets are getting nervous everybody's getting nervous that there might not be a plan i don't know i mean i say i he's the president of the united states i wish his policies well but it's hard to understand exactly where he's going and what he's doing again it feels like a throwback to the 70s in a lot of ways

**Nicolai Tangen** what are your biggest concern when it comes to the current economic policy

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean the the the biggest concern is that we undermine the institutions that are the bedrock of us exceptionalism you trust the rule of law when the united states gives its word it keeps its word i'm not saying we always did that but you know certainly with respect to paying our debts i'm concerned certainly about this view that people who believe in global trade and global integration are globalists i'm an unapologetic globalist myself and this fracturing of the global economy i mean trump sometimes ties and his people sometimes say let's go back to the fifties well we had a lot lower income back in the fifties like okay maybe we'll have more manufacturing jobs maybe but things will cost a lot more i mean it's it's just a little hard to know how much of it's bluster theater he'll retreat obviously early on that's what everyone thought that he was just saying this for his base and he would pull back but you know that's certainly not how it's been going

**Nicolai Tangen** where do you see tariffs a year from now

**Kenneth Rogoff** woah you threw in the year from now i mean it seems like he's spinning a wheel when when he wakes up every morning at first he spins the wheel to see what country it points out and then he spins the wheel to see what tariff he wants to put on and then he changes his mind the next day i mean that's that's a really hard thing to forecast but i i i think he's very intent on it so i'm guessing the us will have tariffs for example on europe on the order of i don't know at least 10 you know 15% twenty % and europe will have retaliated and there'll have been a lot of noise back and forth he seems to be a believer even back in 2016 when he was first running someone who was close to him called me and just for did i have any general thoughts and i said okay first of all this conversation never happened i'm i i can't be seen as talking to you but if you ask me i discussed some things but the tariffs are a terrible idea why are you doing the tariffs this is this is and you know the person said well you know the candidate trump he knows politics better than i do and he thinks 80% of americans love tariffs and actually you know sadly i find that hard to argue with my mother was a librarian a brilliant woman she sadly passed away a few years ago but she liked tariffs and i would i'm an economist and she kinda knew i had a phd in economist and i worked on international economics and i would say yeah but you know it would make everything more expensive and do we really wanna do this and i went into the whole rigmarole about how we buy stuff from them and they buy stuff from us and she just wouldn't give in you know she did not agree and i mean that's a you know very educated woman and so it's very popular and historically this has been one of the issues where the president who knows that people don't like tariffs people like tariffs stands as well you know this you you don't like you don't wanna have to eat your your vegetables but eat them and you'll grow and it'll be better and trump didn't invent this by the way bernie sanders who was came very close to being the candidate in 02/2016 is very influential in the democratic party yeah pretty much the same stuff he he wouldn't agree now but there's not a lot of open water between really the left where the left was in the us and trump i mean it's been one of those things which you know it's been obviously very good globalization has been great for the united states who are we kidding i mean the united states has been at the top that's benefited and yes there are problems with globalization but he he seems to just think it's really good for him we'll we'll see how it plays out

**Nicolai Tangen** how bad are tariffs for globalization

**Kenneth Rogoff** so truth be told if we just slapped on 20% tariffs it would be very bad like a big tax hike it would reduce trade it would interfere with the global supply chains and such it would not be the end of the world if together with that trump did a bunch of sensible things deregulation you know finding ways to improve innovation i don't know but if he did on balance it could be okay they do raise revenue what what's just been so weird about it is the randomness of it just you don't know what's coming it's like he wants everyone to hide from him i sort of look at country i don't know if i ever visited the north pole but the penguins are sort of getting eaten by the polar bear and they're very sad about that but they don't wanna go in and fight the polar bear they sort of hold back and it's how everyone is they want oh go look at the other country and and anyway i i i think the real problem is the randomness and what it signals about other things to come

**Nicolai Tangen** such as

**Kenneth Rogoff** a central bank and dependent segment yeah

**Nicolai Tangen** we'll go back to that again just what will be the impact on inflation from the tariffs

**Kenneth Rogoff** so that is not a big deal i mean it raises prices the united states is pretty closed and it raises prices there'll be a short term effect that's i mean it it won't be pleasant and i think some of it will be inflation some of it lower quality but the the problem is more innovation slowing growth over the longer run

**Nicolai Tangen** and the effect on american consumers

**Kenneth Rogoff** well you know of course we pay the tariffs dollar for dollar every study shows that it shows it on other examples it shows that when he put in tariffs in 02/2018 and so you know this whole story it's a little bit obviously like mexico will pay for the wall the american consumers will pay the tariffs both in terms of higher prices and i think lower quality they're goods that if they revert to the united states will will be lower quality than we got at the moment at least for a long time to come

**Nicolai Tangen** you are a professional chess player and you are still avid in terms of you know playing so how would you so let's say now you're in europe how would you navigate the trade negotiations in the us from like a chess player point of view

**Kenneth Rogoff** first of all i'm still a grand master but i actually haven't played in decades i follow follow at a distance i think you have to combine you know long term strategy what is it we wanna do some of the things trump is forcing europe to do it probably should have done a long time ago i think i've i've said whenever i've given talks in europe over the years or at least often we need europe to be a geopolitical counterweight to the united states you can't every time there's a presidential election and you know you think people think you know this is the worst thing that'll ever happen i don't know what's to come every time there's a presidential election you can't suddenly rethink everything you need a counterbalance and europe for whatever its frictions and divisions probably is a more more stable you don't have one election in france or germany suddenly changing everything change a lot but not everything so that's good on the other end you you you need to think about being more independent in tech that mario draghi the former head of the ecb wrote a report where he made that point where europe's lagged and those two things are connected because military often provides the funding early on for tech tech startups tech investment and i mean then there's short term tactics which actually really hard to know i mean do you supplicate to trump and kiss the ring or which your public hates but then he's not throwing a 200% tariff on you or do you just sort of turn the other cheek and hope that it calms down i mean it's it's it's it's not it's not good in a way but on the other hand it kind of forces europe to get be more assertive to be more independent in a way that i think has been a long time coming

**Nicolai Tangen** will we have a recession in the us

**Kenneth Rogoff** i mean i think the odds have gone up sharply and it's sort of funny but the nature of the recession we might get is a loss of confidence not an oil shock not a pandemic not a global financial crisis but among consumers particularly consumers who didn't vote for trump which is about half of people they think it's the end of the world they think it's 02/1989 the global financial crisis the pandemic the indicators for the democratic voters are just off the charts terrible oddly enough they also think inflation's gonna go through the roof you talk to the republicans everything's ducky the economy is doing fine there's nothing to worry about president's doing a great job inflation's gonna be low and they're looking at the same data and just drawing completely different conclusions now half of all the consumers are

**Nicolai Tangen** democrats have you seen this before that political inclination impacts the way you look at data this way

**Kenneth Rogoff** i've never i've of course we see it but we saw it under biden where the republicans thought inflation was way higher than it was and the democrats thought inflation was way lower than it was i mean just yes what's inflation and the republicans just give a different answer but it is much more pronounced and it can cause a recession because yeah the republicans are not gonna spend enough to make up for what the democrats aren't spending i get so many letters and emails from relatives friends even professional colleagues should i sell everything you know is the world ending

**Nicolai Tangen** should they should they sell everything

**Kenneth Rogoff** well we ask you nikolai on that but no i mean i i my i i say to be calm and i it's very hard for me to stay calm but it's i i i don't know how to second guess all of this

**Nicolai Tangen** what's what's your view on on potential tariffs on capital inflows

**Kenneth Rogoff** well they've been very strong before so the idea was to bring more production into the united states but i i don't think this is something that's gonna be like a first order effect when biden put his kind of called it inflation reduction act but his environment act that had a ton of subsidies to invest in the united states and i think a lot of europeans were really angry about that saying you know this is just basic trade war you're incentivizing people to invest in the united states this violates general principles so trump didn't invent us i mean the tariffs are different than the subsidies we were giving subsidies to invest in the us but it's six of one and half a dozen of the other you know it's i think economists would say it's not a very good way to run your business it's better to have an environment where the regulation and the general work environment for companies is good and makes them want to invest i mean i won't ask you to comment but people were pouring their money into the us the us as you well know had been outperforming yeah the last ten years some remarkable data about that so exactly how you're improving things now i don't know

**Nicolai Tangen** do you believe there is such a thing as a trump put

**Kenneth Rogoff** where is he gonna put it i mean he's no but when he when he makes sure he's he'll he'll he'll pull back is what you're saying yeah so you don't have to sell because he's sounding untethered but it's all gonna pull back at the at the at the at the same time he clearly looks at the market but this is someone who's very determined to put his place in history he i don't know if it came from his childhood or something but he has this deep belief that tariffs are beautiful he says it again and again it seemed to have worked very well for him politically he in his first term when he said something he delivered it and so i i don't you know that that was certainly the fit the thinking that the markets had was that he would pull back now i wanna emphasize that real concern's the randomness of it if if he just put in tariffs which we did think he was gonna do and you know 10% twenty % it it would not have been the end of the world bad idea but not crippling yeah it would hurt growth in the long run it would hurt us welfare but you know nothing to nothing compared to some of the bigger things that go on so i don't i don't believe in a trump put put i think he has conviction you know you never know from day to day like tomorrow maybe he'll pull the tariffs off but in a year i'll have a tantrum at someone and they'll be back

**Nicolai Tangen** yeah let's move on to the dollar what's so what's your view now on on the us dollar's global role

**Kenneth Rogoff** so i think and my book argues that we sort of reached the peak ten years ago in terms of the dollar's footprint and dominance in the global economy and in lots of different measures you know how many reserves people hold number of transactions in dollars what's priced in dollars and we won't need to go into the hell they all kinda tell the same story and i think there's this what i sort of portray there is there's there's sense in which the dollar has been lucky at different stages the us has been good the us system's good but as the us has faced challengers i think they've fallen short more than i would have guessed and it it doesn't mean we have the euro instead of the dollar but it is a surprise that the euro right now is a regional currency it's just basically not a central currency outside of europe and of course the yen's hardly used at all the renminbi even less and i'm old enough i don't know if you are but i'm old enough to remember when russia was considered much more seriously as an economic counterweight and we've been lucky i actually towards the end of the book quote the danish grandmaster ben larson and he was asked would you rather be lucky or good and he said i'd rather be lucky and good and i think americans forget the lucky part we just beat ourselves on the chest we're the greatest country in the world everybody loves us so i think there are a lot of trends pushing towards the dollar still being at the top but not quite as much king of the hill as we as we were

**Nicolai Tangen** is there a scenario where the dollar loses its status as the world reserve currency in a bit more dramatic fashion what what could what could cause that

**Kenneth Rogoff** it would be great for the sales of my book with carmen reinhart that you mentioned at the beginning to have a crisis of that magnitude i mean the the the global currency normally changes slowly you you know you have the spanish peseta

**Nicolai Tangen** it's like hundred years right

**Kenneth Rogoff** yeah like a hundred years and there's usually you know you die a slow death over time and the newcomer comes up and you're even for a while and i i would describe the dollar as late middle age at the moment you know there's no nobody's gonna take over right now but for it to actually disappear you wouldn't have seen it but there's actually a movie last year something like called civil war where it's a dystopian not so distant future where the dollars become worthless and everybody uses the canadian dollar instead i don't know you know but no i don't see it happen dramatic happening dramatically

**Nicolai Tangen** so how do you assess other nations' efforts to decouple from the dollar then

**Kenneth Rogoff** well there's the polemic stuff like when lula says he doesn't wanna use the dollar in brazil and he he has no power i mean he's not able to do anything but i think the chinese take it very seriously of wanting it's not that they wanna get everyone for everything to use the renminbi their chinese currency instead it's that they wanna expand its footprint more things priced in chinese currency more loans priced in chinese currency and they've got a couple of reasons for this first of all they should have done that twenty years ago i mean i haven't had engagement with them for over twenty years and have been puzzled they haven't done that if you're the euro is not pegged to the dollar there's a good reason the euro is not pegged to the dollar yet forever they had the renminbi this big economy with its own business cycles its own problems over time it has become a little looser but i think what's really scared the daylights out of them is watching what the us has tried to do to russia with the sanctions and you know we don't know but china is certainly thinking about provoking the ire of the united states at some point by trying to take over taiwan and looking at the sanctions and it isn't just the sanctions it's the ability of the united states to see everything and a thing many people don't understand about the military and power and dominance of the united states is the us gets to make the rules of the game when bankers are negotiating over you know what kind of transactions mechanism should we have how swift is something people may have heard of them international messaging system that's used by banks all of these negotiations the us you know it's not like they say it's our bomb and we're gonna go home if you don't do what we want but they can and it gives them this tremendous power and so many things go through the united states we donald trump can possibly see some things you bought because the clearing goes through the united states if it touches the dollar most of it goes to united states so by getting more things into renminbi by getting more things into the chinese currency and developing their own the word is rails but their own clearing mechanisms they can get around this that's that's as big as all the other things that the chinese are looking at when they're trying to diversify

**Nicolai Tangen** so official chinese gdp growth is around 5% some people think it's lower and you are quite skeptical when it comes to the official figure as well right

**Kenneth Rogoff** yeah absolutely they're throwing people in in jail for questioning the figure of their academics who said in too publicly that they thought the growth was overstated and they got in trouble

**Nicolai Tangen** what are the global implications of chinese economic slowdown

**Kenneth Rogoff** well it's very big on energy exporters and commodity exporters i mean if you if we were to turn around and tell you that china's growth's gonna be 8% the next two or three years instead of i think it's gonna be two or 3% probably that would be very good for inflows into the norwegian sovereign wealth fund i mean and for norway in general and for the united states as a big energy producer and good for brazil and good for argentina so that's one aspect another aspect is the fact that they're in trouble has panicked their savers we were talking about the democrats in the united states people in china are they have no confidence in the regime they have they have just lost confidence so they're trying to get people to consume but it's just collapsed so they're forced to do a lot of artificial stuff to create the mirage of this figure of 5% and that that loss of confidence has pushed interest rates down they're going up all over the world we can come to that but in china they've been going down they actually have deflation and by the way if your prices are going down continually and you're telling me you have 5% growth i don't believe you i mean it's just hard to sustain so how does that affect the rest of the world if they push that money out to the rest of the world in the form of trade surpluses and such it'll have a big effect but i don't think the rest of the world's gonna accept that

**Nicolai Tangen** so do we have some kind of japanification in china now then

**Kenneth Rogoff** yes we do the question's a matter of degree so we those of us who work on financial crises look at sweden on the one end as like the fastest recovery ever and the other end is japan which by some measures took two decades china's sweden time is over that's gone they're having a longer crisis than that it looks to me like it'll be a few more years i don't i don't i think that china has a lot of things going for it but they have this over centralization of power which you know may undermine their longer term growth but it's you know certainly the the the deflation the slow growth the housing problem the overbuilding and infrastructure and housing the similarities are are really quite remarkable

**Nicolai Tangen** what about their ability to intervene in the market in different ways

**Kenneth Rogoff** well the thing is where china was doing really well was their private sector they're they were very innovative their areas of tech where they're just fantastic and they're great investments in china if you could make them now but they they crush them you know famously jack ma who recently reappeared it's sort of he's the founder of alibaba and one of the great innovators at china just sort of disappeared and you know he was a little too vocal about his power they started putting party hacks on the boards of financial firms of you know their tech companies so they need to go back to this growth model where the private sector leads and the state's not doing everything but president xi has been very reluctant to let go of that power he's worried about instability

**Nicolai Tangen** there is quite a bit of manufacturing moving out of china how does this impact the situation

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean there's still quite a manufacturing force but it's reduced invest it's reduced investment into china so it's been great for japan for korea for singapore malaysia even indonesia and india so as you well know a lot of companies have this china plus one strategy meaning we're leaving our stuff in china and by the way they can't get it out right now anyway and we're gonna do our new investments we're gonna do our new investments somewhere else but i don't think that alone is the big thing the big thing is that housing real estate's plummeting consumers are panicked they don't trust the government they're not spending that's really the big impetus of why they're so going growing so slowly

**Nicolai Tangen** a few sentences on india where do you see that

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean india has been a positive story for a while right i mean we can still point to a lot of problems in india but they have faster growth rates than china who'd have thought that and seemed to be for a while modi is building infrastructure finally in india that you know is laying the groundwork for future growth they still have myriad problems a few monopolies dominate a lot of the economy we're talking about donald trump's tariffs india's already there and they they've actually come down some but you know not not not enough so you know it's doing well i sorry i have to come back to chefs the he's not he's not as good as your boy magnus carlsen who pulled out of things but you know the world champion gookesh is from india amazing and they won the world team championship too

**Nicolai Tangen** i think i sent you the podcast with magnus carlsen

**Kenneth Rogoff** you did you did and thank you and so if you can do that you can do other things and so i'm that you know they're they're i'm i'm optimistic but it's hard to get euphoric about india because it's just so hard to govern a country of 1,400,000,000 people

**Nicolai Tangen** moving on to inflation how has your view on inflation changed over the last ten years

**Kenneth Rogoff** so i have always thought inflation was in remission and not dead and my academic papers have made this case my colleagues across all of academics i think became in somehow mesmerized brainwashed by central bank saying there's never gonna be inflation nothing to worry about that assumption of no inflation is hardwired into all the top journal papers that have been coming out i mean i have a paper with some co authors that has a different idea i think in fact the period where inflation was really low the central banks were good going back to ben larson but they were also lucky because globalization helped the rise of china helped there was a general consensus away from populist policies more or less and that helped they had the they had the wind at their backs now they don't and not only do they have the wind at their backs in terms of these techno factors but the politics were leave the central bank alone and that has been thrown by the wayside in many countries so inflation doesn't have to be high the central banks can control inflation but economists prognosticators opinion makers had just forgotten that inflation is a political economy problem and if you don't really have central bank independence that's the core of it you're gonna periodically run into trouble

**Nicolai Tangen** is 2% still a realistic target

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean i you're asking are they gonna ever get down to 2% again i think what i think is they will but we will see in the next my book says five to seven years but that was the i did the page the final day of page proofs was just the day after trump got elected i might make that a little faster now than five to seven years there's gonna be another big burst of inflation similar to what we saw in the after the pandemic

**Nicolai Tangen** what's going to cause that surge

**Kenneth Rogoff** what's gonna cause that will be another shock where the central banks are you know get put into a corner where they worry about recession they worry about inflation but the pressures are gonna be towards worrying about having a recession and they're just not gonna be able to stand up to the politics the way they might have say in 2,008 and 02/2009 so it depends on what kind of shock we get if we get another one just like 02/2008 we won't but i think there are a lot of kinds of shocks call it a cyber war another pandemic where it's very hard to maintain growth and keep inflation low so you know it's it's hard to put my finger on exactly what it would be but a lot of kinds of shocks could make could make them need to raise interest rates i mean that's really what we're talking about us debt being out of control if that goes i don't know what's happening but my best guess is if both parties want it to go up and it will it it's gonna put upward pressure on interest rates and if the federal reserve raises interest rates no problem there won't be inflation good luck with that even if trump wasn't president it's they're already high it's very hard to do so so it's i'm making a political economy call i'm not saying there's some you know constellation of shocks that's just gonna happen in a certain way and create inflation i'm saying that when the going gets tough some of the you know some of them are gonna hide and not fight the fight

**Nicolai Tangen** when do you think we'll start to see it move up

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean this is like forecasting a financial crisis we can say what happens once the shock hits you know at the moment i i don't see it happening at all near term

**Nicolai Tangen** what would be the most likely trigger what's the what's what are the most important things you look at

**Kenneth Rogoff** i i mean having some the most likely trigger for getting a really big shock is some out of the box thing happening that we haven't seen before for a long time and we need it

**Nicolai Tangen** such as what

**Kenneth Rogoff** well why don't i throw out another pandemic because that's an easy one but i also think the possibility of a say a cyber war is not far off and

**Nicolai Tangen** just explain to us why a cyber war will drive inflation

**Kenneth Rogoff** well it cuts growth and then the government does stuff to try to hold up consumption by spending money a debt a venture debt doesn't just mechanically turn into inflation that's wrong it either turns into higher interest rates or inflation and at some point you know i think there'll be pressures to you know they'll pack the central bank with people who we call doves it doesn't happen but you know it could or obviously we have trump here and he has said he thinks he's smarter than the central bankers he'd like a bigger voice i think a lot of people don't understand is the central the fed is not the supreme court it does not have that kind of constitutional status that the ecb does have and it it could disappear in a week and by the way it isn't just trump that wants it to disappear the left wants it to disappear too they have all these plans they wanna you know have it print money and give it away to people so there's there's a lot of pressures on on the fed's independence coming from both sides of the spectrum

**Nicolai Tangen** one more question before we spend more time on the fed the climate how can the climate suddenly impact inflation in your mind

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean i think a thing that is likely is that storms are gonna get worse so i think a big thing that we've learned over the last few years it had always been about what was gonna happen in 2100 was that these storms and climate extremes that we're experiencing are coming faster so you have natural catastrophes which lower output and put upward pressure you could have geopolitical issues arise say with migration al gore writes about that talks about this a lot so i think the climate's providing i think i'm glad you raised it because i should have said it you could have some kind of climate shock that's just out of the box we don't know how to deal with that and we deal with that by spending a lot of money which i'm not saying would necessarily be wrong but you then have a choice to raise interest rates or do allow inflation to go up and i bet we'd allow inflation to go up

**Nicolai Tangen** just coming back to the political pressures that the fed is facing now just what could you elaborate a bit more on that please

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean the the most fundamental point is that fed independence is a new thing central bank independence is a new thing i mean the fed was not the federal reserve has this grand building that you see pictures of you've probably been to in the twenties and you know early thirties they were in a room in the treasury a few people this whole they were part of the treasury in most countries the central bank was part of the treasury the notion of central bank independence which i by the way i think i wrote the first paper on just forty years ago now and back then almost no one had independent central banks it's new it's experimental and there are a lot of people who are saying well it's had its benefits but now that inflation's down we don't need it anymore it we it was useful to bring inflation down now we don't need it which of course you know they don't they don't see that that's why inflation is down because you have central bank independence but it's it's political it doesn't have to be it's not it's not something you know that's in our constitution i couldn't comment on the ecb really as remarkably more independent but i think in most countries that's not the case

**Nicolai Tangen** so how likely are we to see that the fed loses its independence

**Kenneth Rogoff** well that's a strong statement of you know loses its independence what i would say is near term likely and i'm gonna come back to drawing parallels between trump and nixon i think after he's done with doge and all this pseudo cutting which isn't gonna lead to that much and finally gets to the big tax cuts and other stimulus and maybe by creating a recession out of thin air trump will have provided political cover for him to do all this stimulus we are gonna start to get inflation pressures trump is not gonna like it trump is not a person who sits back and quietly takes things when he doesn't like it i i think and this may sound really out there i think we're gonna see nixon like price controls like we saw in the nineteen seventies maybe you know other kinds of controls we're gonna see things like we reinhardt and i label financial repression which we have to some degree now since the financial crisis where banks and financial firms are forced to hold more debt at ending up at lower returns than they'd like so i think that you know kind of wilder stuff like that is coming to a theater near you soon i don't think we're gonna wait to the fourth year of the trump presidency for that that stuff doesn't work indefinitely it works for a little while and then eventually you know things spin out of control so you know we're in for a wild ride so sort of trying to make a smooth prediction like i think inflation in 2026 is gonna be 5% i don't know what side of bad donald trump's gonna weigh out up on i don't know if vladimir putin either but i do see this willingness just like with the tariffs to use things that we globalist economists think are bad he'll say they're good i think they're good he'll say i think they're good and so i i i think we're gonna see him reach into the toolkit and you know fed independence comes later the fed does not like this stuff but you know that's that's sort of something that comes further down the road

**Nicolai Tangen** okay so let's say now inflation climbs jobs are strong politicians don't want rates higher what will the fed do

**Kenneth Rogoff** no i think i think if left to its own devices it will raise interest rates i don't think there's any doubt about it

**Nicolai Tangen** what form will the pressure come

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i mean it's it's it's the the immediate pressure if jobs are strong it's nevertheless the case that there are people who lose by having interest rates high you know i talk to young people and tell them you're earning a lot more than i did at your age and they say yeah but look what a house costs look at how high interest rates are people who are buying cards i mean people care about interest rates a lot so no but i i think the current fed right here and now without some you know real turn of the screw coming from congress coming from the president oh they're they're gonna raise interest rates if they see inflation but that's that's gonna lead to a showdown at some point because nothing's perfect it's not just gonna be this perfect world with jobs going up and interest rates are high because everybody's doing so well it's it's it's not gonna be that simple so

**Nicolai Tangen** how important is business sentiment in shaping monetary policy

**Kenneth Rogoff** not as important as consumer sentiment because consumer sentiment's 70% of consumers are 70% of consumption but it's a business sentiment certainly very important i mean it affects investment investment affects future growth and i'd also say the federal reserve probably takes the business forecast to be a little more professional than the consumers when the professionals are saying you're doing a bad job they listen a little more but i i wouldn't i the fed listens to everybody business sentiment's important financial market sentiment political sentiment consumer sentiment they even listen a little bit to economists like me but you know it's not i i don't think there's any one thing that's oversized

**Nicolai Tangen** is that a good thing to listen to economists

**Kenneth Rogoff** well what am i gonna say no but i i i i i think i think you know when it comes to the fed the only complaint i would have about my professional colleagues what i see in the journals is they just became mesmerized that there'd never be inflation

**Nicolai Tangen** yeah

**Kenneth Rogoff** so actually a lot of them have really leaned into this idea the fed should deal with the environment social justice inequality and all of those things are really important they're very valuable but it's wrong and actually a survey of the american economic association just a couple years ago showed incredible naivete among academic economists about where the fed's focus should be it should be on inflation

**Nicolai Tangen** should central banks spend time on climate issues

**Kenneth Rogoff** basically it let me start with the fed and i would say of course they should follow whatever policy is set by congress but they shouldn't be leading the pack the fed doesn't have the personnel it doesn't have the knowledge and above all it doesn't have the democratic accountability to be the leader and pushing the fed to be the leader in climate change is just a ticket to having it lose its focus and i would say you know i would say the same thing about inequality and of course fed policy affects inequality but in a very difficult to calibrate way congress should fix it now the ecb is different and my friend christine lagarde would certainly raise her eyebrows if i were saying you shouldn't look at you know the environment i would say the ecb is following euro euro european dictates it's not telling it's not making its own forecast of the environment but that's sad i i find it very thin pretext for having the ecb intervene by saying you're not worrying about the business risks coming from the environment enough we're worrying about the business risks i mean i i think businesses are pretty good at worrying about their own business risks so it it shouldn't be that that central bank should be a team player but very much a follower when it comes to the environment

**Nicolai Tangen** talking about what central banks should or shouldn't do should they publish forward guidance curves for interest rates

**Kenneth Rogoff** i i think that's been overdone i think the whole thing that came under another friend of mine ben bernanke who is you know a great fed chair but i think this whole thing about here's the dot plot here that that tells where they think interest rates are going you know here's everything we think we're gonna do it got overdone and the problem is markets don't believe it and then you get to a year later and the feds a little bit tied its hands by giving this forward guidance or the central bank the bank of england central bank of norway they they've tied their hands a little bit and you know in some sense they're the only ones listening to themselves

**Nicolai Tangen** but how how tied are they how tied are they by their own forecast

**Kenneth Rogoff** well they're not completely tied but it's awkward

**Nicolai Tangen** you know was it the was that the reason why the why the ecb was slow to increase rates for instance you think

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i think they i i think that i said part partly it was a case where a lot of people were thrown off in their forecast i think the main reason everyone was slow to increase rates really was that they wanted to be the things looked like they could get really bad they didn't get really bad and they were trying to be cautious i just wanna make one point about this i often hear the line that well it was just the supply side it was just supply chain problems that made prices go up that's why we had inflation okay fine but then the supply chain problems went away why didn't the price of paper towels come down why didn't the price of everything come down that was a central bank mistake i mean they they we could go off into the theory of it that they should look through temporary shocks but that if this was a big shock they they screwed up on this they they should have raised interest rates sooner

**Nicolai Tangen** yeah moving on to debt is the current level of us debt sustainable

**Kenneth Rogoff** well yes and no i mean no in the sense with on its current path it's gonna have to get resolved by inflation it's not gonna get i think that again going back to my colleagues in the profession there were these people who argued interest rates would be lower forever larry summers had this i don't know if you've ever had this line in your podcast secular stagnation we're never gonna grow again interest rates will be low we're not inventing anything everybody's getting old and i debated this with him ten years ago paul krugman even peter thiel actually gary kasparov at one time and i've always thought you know that people are very short they're looking at the recent past too much and if you look at a longer time period you would see that this period of low interest rates was going to go away i think it has and if it if interest rates come way down well any debt sustainable if you don't have to pay interest on it but with the level we have and the rate it's going we're gonna need be need needing to make adjustments i don't think politicians have prepared people to make the adjustments so at the you know what i see happening eventually and it'll happen together with a big shock like we discussed pandemic we're gonna have a big inflation that's gonna partly bring the debt down but this time interest rates are gonna go up a lot more investors were forgiving last time to both the ecb and the fed and others that okay that was an accident we really believe you it's not gonna happen again you know fool me once shame on shame on you etcetera so i i think we're eventually gonna have to make these adjustments but so far no one's really been prepared for that

**Nicolai Tangen** what kind of adjustments can we

**Kenneth Rogoff** see well you either lower raise taxes or lower spending i mean you have to do something to do with adjusting what you're spending the us is running a i think it's a 7% of gdp deficit this year i mean and it'll come down a bit but who knows how much all the projections are the debts currently at 36,000,000,000,000 the congressional budget office i think has it going to 65,000,000,000,000 in ten years so there are lots of things you can't i'm not tell i'm not about what you should adjust i'm not about the size of government that's a separate question but you know some kind of adjustments will need to be made and one of the things that has really puzzled me throughout all this is that particularly on the left they just wanna make debt really big that's been the argument for a long time anyone who thinks that big debt is a problem is in favor of austerity they think you must not wanna give people stuff and i would say no just raise taxes if you wanna give people more stuff and bigger transfers all for it more power to you but raise taxes this whole idea of it's a free lunch you can just give everything away you're shooting yourself in the foot which the biden administration did to some extent and on the right they say oh we can do whatever we want because when we cut taxes growth just soars doesn't cost anything and it soars a little but it doesn't pay for itself so they both been telling this fiction which i think now interest rates are saying the markets don't believe

**Nicolai Tangen** where is a debt level where investors suddenly will demand a sharply higher coupon

**Kenneth Rogoff** no but i don't i don't think in the case of the united states that happens because we we have the inflation card to play and you can play it a little you can play it a lot so when you go to an emerging market that borrows in dollars it can happen very suddenly that greece was an example they were borrowing in europe but they didn't control it it happened very suddenly i think in the case of the united states it's more you'll see it in the interest rate but probably not you know all at once it's gone up after people you know see what's going on but i think this whole idea i mean having really high debt for an advanced country weighs on growth because it reduces your options you you're a little more nervous about doing stimulus you're a little more nervous about doing investment but it's not it's you know it's a question of what kind of risk what's coming in the future let's look at europe oops they have to build up their military we didn't budget for that and you know that's just an example and i by the way i think europe's gonna end up having to put a lot more in than leaders are beginning to talk about yet

**Nicolai Tangen** why do you say that

**Kenneth Rogoff** i mean i think the united states even if harris had won she was the one opposing trump is not prepared to defend europe the middle east and asia at the same time the us defense budget which is like 8% of gdp towards the end of the cold wars three and a half percent of gdp now i think it will go up again regardless of harris or trump winning but most of the foreign policy experts i talked to think the us does not have the capacity to project power in two regions at once much less three and so it's going to fall to europe to take more responsibility and it's it's not just going to two percent there's decades of underinvestment that need to be made up for and that that's gonna be that's gonna be a big adjustment for europe

**Nicolai Tangen** yeah do you see a scenario where the us defaults on its treasury bonds

**Kenneth Rogoff** i mean again it would be so good for sales of my book with carmen reinhart from 02/2009 if that happened but you know in in it it it would be total dysfunction to do that it would be so stupid because we we can print money we don't need to default on our treasury bonds so you know

**Nicolai Tangen** we restructure them can you restructure them into longer duration obligations

**Kenneth Rogoff** that's not gonna happen what already happened after the financial crisis was we put in all these restrictions to make the banks safer that had them basically hold more fed debt which is basically treasury bonds and more treasury bonds so we can put in restrictions we can put in rules the us has a lot of cars to buy and look at japan japan's debt's very high their growth's been terrible by the way but their debt's very high they have a lot of financial repression in japan and they haven't had growth but they're they're if if you're printing one of the big currencies that and you have a lot of cards you can play so looking for something sudden a sudden turn i think you know not where it's going of course enter the real the ten year inflation index treasury when larry summers did a secular stagnation speech was average zero over those ten years that got to minus one now it's around two you know that's a 3% swing and us interest payments have gone up in a short period from $250,000,000,000 to nearly a trillion and that's very painful but for the moment there are ways to adjust but you know it's certainly one doesn't really feel like comfortable with what's going on right now and that's one of the reasons i think if we come back to my thesis that the us dollar peaked in 02/2015 there's the competition from china crypto but a lot of the big problems are inside the unwillingness to confront debt concerns about the independence of the central bank you know just like that was the problem in rome at the end of the day i think that's also going to weaken the dollar and the dollar's footprint a lot

**Nicolai Tangen** in yoran karman's book this time is different you lay out the potential consequences of big debt buildups now how did the aftermath of the financial crisis match your predictions

**Kenneth Rogoff** well actually you know uncannily so i mean if you look at we we gave that by the way we were looking at private financial crises and not government debt crises and what we're talking about and and i think what you're talking about but you know if you look at how much unemployment went up on average in the us how long it lasted how much stock markets fell how much housing prices fell it was remarkably on our on our averages we we didn't write them as predictions we just said these are the averages there were a lot of people making fun of us when our book came out the new york times had almost a two page article saying these crazy people think this recession's gonna last a long time they think the stock market's gonna go down further they think housing prices won't come back for years and you know now the you know the debate has certainly changed around financial crises

**Nicolai Tangen** why haven't the big debt levels in europe been a problem

**Kenneth Rogoff** yeah but i mean so we didn't write about that in our book we had a paper papers after that we just argued it weighed on growth when you're a big rich country it's the case of japan so if you look at italy you look at japan obviously greece but you can go to france this has weighed on growth the the europe has wildly underperformed the last ten years

**Nicolai Tangen** and how much of this is due to the high debt levels you think

**Kenneth Rogoff** well i think the high debt levels cripple some of the responses that europe needs to invest more in infrastructure to improve education on occasion to do a stimulus when there's a transaction i i you know i would say i mean i wouldn't wanna overstate the weight it's very hard to parse that but if you look at you know how much particularly after the global financial crisis look at the low debt countries and how much they were able to stimulate their economies they did better germany is able to do stuff now because it has saved for a rainy day and it's a rainy day and they're making use of it i i think they should have made use of it sooner but you know i mean you know it depends on how you spend the money obviously i mean that's not the be all and end all of macro policy you care about education investment you know helping with smoothing over recessions but the people who let me put this another way running deficits is great it's good for your economy having a big debt is not good for your economy because it prevents you from as easily running deficits and there are all these people who said you shouldn't care it doesn't matter what and that that was that was nutty and unfortunately became almost a religion in some circles

**Nicolai Tangen** i think if you add up all the all the government debt across the world according to imf where you were the chief economist for some time it's a hundred trillion dollars right what so what's going to happen here given what you are seeing now deglobalization tariffs central bank independence i mean all the geopolitical issues we see just how how will this mountain of debt pan out

**Kenneth Rogoff** well so the good news is that central bank independence up to this point has worked it's given people more confidence it allowed debt levels to be higher maybe than they would have otherwise but i i think a lot of this question has to do with where do you think interest rates are going that you people often say is this debt level high is that debt level high well tell me what interest rate you're paying and i can give you a lot better answer a lot of the this debate around debt took place when there was this you know zealous belief that interest rates would stay zero and so why ever think about it they're not they're not in your country they're not in my country they're not in many places around the world and interest payments have gone up it's more painful and i think you know countries will need to make adjustments but it's it's not something that you know necessarily precipitates change immediately you know the next time there's a big crisis in europe with these kind of interest rates it maybe it's gonna be a little harder to work out a package when it doesn't seem like a free lunch i i think what europe did during the pandemic was great but interest rates were negative so wasn't very hard to persuade the germans to do it now they're not

**Nicolai Tangen** can can we spend a moment on technology is there a could it be that we potentially underestimate the deflationary effect of new technology including ai what do you think

**Kenneth Rogoff** absolutely we could so you know it's possible that technology will produce an effect like globalization did putting downward pressure on wages and putting downward pressure on prices and that's a distinct possibility but on the other hand i think ai is also gonna lead to a lot of political tensions a lot of worker displacement so yes there's definitely a bright side ai and i've been arguing that for for years back when i did the debate with peter thiel and gary kasparov just over a decade ago they were arguing this idea there wouldn't be growth again and i saw i'm a chess player i see what's going on with ai it looks to me like it's gonna be good what worries me is that it's gonna be so fast humans mankind will not be able to adjust to it and that's what worries me right now the you know the potentially chaotic change that could happen with ai we obviously see it in warfare but we may see it in the workplace as well

**Nicolai Tangen** you know we are just seeing a dramatic increase in efficiency in our firm on the back of it last year probably 15% i suspect this year we'll see 20% efficiency gain it's just you know totally democratized the way people around the firm here code and automate and it's just unbelievable

**Kenneth Rogoff** no and there are many firms like yours so so that's really interesting but creating efficiencies it's doing a lot of good things

**Nicolai Tangen** and some people like you know vinod khosla the venture capitalist believes that computer will be free labor will be free on the back of robots and so on i mean can we then at the end actually use gdp to measure the economy

**Kenneth Rogoff** well it's been a long time since gdp was a really accurate measure of the economy there are a lot of things it doesn't capture but you know it's a it's a there's a it's a very difficult world that our children face with tremendous uncertainty about what jobs are i see so many people graduate college trying to see how to make a million dollars in a year because they don't know what they'll be doing in three years they they don't wanna plan a career that's gonna go away it's very unsettling i i try to be an optimist about it but i i don't buy this idea that don't worry about inflation because this is gonna make everything cheaper these political pressures on central banks are very very powerful so i think inflation is gonna be a problem for the next several decades even though i do think ai will transform our lives

**Nicolai Tangen** do you think the high valuations in ai related companies and a potential in deflation head could trigger a new financial crisis

**Kenneth Rogoff** well a lot of financial crises have come because there's a new technology and everybody gets all excited about it the the steam engines railroads airplanes you know you name it often there's a new technology everybody thinks it's amazing and it's hard to evaluate i mean it hard to know what it what it's worth so of course there's a lot of volatility around it and there's the potential to have you know sudden valuation changes collapses i you know hesitate to say that i don't see a financial crisis around the corner but i don't right now there's an awful lot of regulation which makes it more difficult i think if we get a financial crisis look for it coming out of crypto rather than necessarily high valuations of ai firms

**Nicolai Tangen** where are you the most different from other economists in your views now you think

**Kenneth Rogoff** well where i have been different for some in many places over the years but right now where i've been different is i was sort of all alone in arguing that real interest rates weren't gonna be low forever among academic economists people write in opinion pages i was alone in saying when they rise debt which seems like a free lunch today is not gonna be i would say i was also pretty isolated in saying china was not gonna grow to the moon that it would have a financial crisis i think to some extent you know though i'm i'm still fringe on saying those things believe it or not but less so one thing i say in my book is that the dollar is not gonna be what you're used to that it reached its peak and it's coming down that is way out of consensus and i again i i i think we did see some of that in the nixon era i think we're gonna see it again but you know that that i i've sort of discussed over the the our time you know some of the reasons i thought that was true it's not just the dollar is gonna come down in value i think that too but that its footprint is gonna fall we live in a dollar dominant world the dollar's gonna stay first but gradually its place is gonna come down

**Nicolai Tangen** well ken it's been amazing tapping into your your insights and and visions so big thank you for spending time with us and very much very much look forward to to keeping in touch and i'm just so happy i don't have to face you on the you know on the chessboard

**Kenneth Rogoff** you do fine i've i've i was it's been many decades but i look forward to speaking to you again soon

**Nicolai Tangen** very good thanks a million

**Kenneth Rogoff** so long bye
