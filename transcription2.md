**Speaker 0:** up in the mountains of new hampshire they laid the foundation for pax americano the architects of bretton woods recognized that a global economy required global coordination to encourage that coordination they created the imf and the world bank these twin institutions were born after a period of intense geopolitical and economic volatility the purpose of the imf and the world bank was to better align national interest with international order thereby bringing stability to an unstable world in short their purpose was to restore and preserve balance this remains the purpose of the bretton woods institutions yet everywhere we look across the international system today we see imbalance the good news it doesn't have to be this way my goal this morning is to outline a blueprint to restore equilibrium to the global financial system and the institutions designed to uphold it i have spent the bulk of my career from the outside looking in on financial policy circles now i am on the inside looking out i am eager to work with each of you to restore order to the international system to achieve this however we've let's first reconstruct the imf and world bank with or reconnect the imf and the world bank with their founding missions the imf and world bank have enduring value but mission creep has knocked these institutions off course we must enact key reforms to ensure the bretton woods institutions are serving their stakeholders not the other way around bringing balance back to global finance will would will require clear eyed leadership from the imf and world bank this morning i will explain how they can provide that leadership to build safer stronger and more prosperous economies all around the world i wish to invite my international counterparts to join us in working toward these goals on this point i wish to be clear america first does not mean america alone to the contrary it is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners far from stepping back america first seeks to expand us leadership and international institutions like the imf and the world bank by embracing a stronger leadership role america first seeks to restore fairness to the international economic system nowhere is the imbalance i mentioned earlier more obvious than in the world of trade that's why the united states is taking action now to rebalance global commerce for decades successive administrations relied on faulty assumptions that our trading partners would implement policies that would drive a balanced global economy instead we face the stark reality of large and persistent us deficits as a result of an unfair trading system intentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out america's manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains putting our national and economic security at risk president trump has taken strong actions to address these imbalances and the negative impacts they have on americans the status quo of large and persistent imbalances is not sustainable it is not sustainable for the united states and ultimately it is not sustainable for other economies now i know sustainability is a popular term around here but i'm not talking about climate change or carbon footprints i'm talking about economic and financial stability the kind of sustainability that raises standards of living and keeps markets afloat international financial institutions must be singularly focused on upholding this kind of sustainability if they are to succeed in their missions in response to president trump's tariff announcements more than a hundred countries have approached us wanting to help rebalance global trade these countries have responded openly and positively to the president's actions to create a more balanced international system we are engaged in meaningful discussions and look forward to talking with others china in particularly in particular is in need of a rebalancing recent data shows the chinese economy tilting even further away from consumption toward manufacturing china's economic system with growth driven by manufacturing exports will continue to create even more serious imbalances with its trading partners if the status quo is allowed to continue china's current economic model is built on exporting its way out of its economic troubles it's an unsustainable model that is not only harming china but the entire world china needs to change the country knows it needs to change everyone knows it needs to change and we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too china can start by moving its economy away from export overcapacity and towards supporting its own consumers and domestic demand such a ship would help with global rebalancing that the world desperately needs of course trade is not the only factor in broader global economic imbalances the persistent overreliance on the united states for demand is resulting in an evermore unbalanced global economy some countries policies encourage excess savings which holds back private sector led growth others keep wages artificially depressed which also suppresses growth these practices contribute to global dependence on us demand to spur growth they also lead to a global economy that is weaker and more vulnerable than it should be in europe former ecb president mario draghi has identified several sources of stagnation and he has outlined several recommendations to get the european economy back on the right track european countries would do well to take his recommendations to heart europe has already taken some long overdue initial steps that i applaud these steps create a new source of global demand and also involve europe stepping up on the security front i believe global economic relationships should come to reflect security partnerships security partners are more likely to have compatible economies structure structured for mutually beneficial trade if the united states continues offering security guarantees and open markets then our allies must step up with stronger commitments to shared defense the initial actions from europe on increased fiscal and defense spending are proof that the trump administration's policies are indeed working the trump administration and the us treasury are committed to maintaining and expanding us economic leadership in the world this is especially true at the international financial institutions the imf and world bank serve critical roles in the international system and the trump administration is eager to work with them so long as they can stay true to their missions and under the status quo they are falling short the bretton woods institutions must step back from their sprawling and unfocused agendas which have stifled their ability to deliver on their core mandates going forward the trump administration will leverage us leadership and influence at these institutions and push them to accomplish their very important mandates the united states will also demand that the management and staffs of these institutions be accountable for demonstrating real progress i invite all of you to join us in working to refocus these institutions on their core missions it is in our collective interest to do so the imf first we must make the imf the imf again the imf mission is to promote international monetary cooperation facilitate the balanced growth of international trade encourage economic growth and discourage harmful policies like competitive exchange rate depreciation these are crucially important functions to support the us and global economies instead the imf has suffered from mission creep the imf was once unwavering in its mission of promoting global monetary cooperation and financial stability now it devotes disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change gender and social issues these issues are not the imf's mission and the imf's focus in these areas is crowding out its work on critical macroeconomic issues the imf must be a brutal truth teller and not just to some members today imf the imf has been whistling past the graveyard its 2024 external sector report was entitled imbalances receding this pollyannaish outlook is symptomatic of an institution more dedicated to preserving the status quo than answering the hard questions here in the united states we know we need to get our fiscal house in order the last administration ran up the largest peace time deficit in our nation's history the current administration is committed to fixing this we are open to critique but we will not abide the imf failing to critique the countries that most needed principally surplus countries in line with its core mandate the imf needs to call out countries like china that have pursued globally distorted policies and opaque currency practices for many decades i also expect the imf to call out unsustainable lending practices by certain creditor countries the imf should push more proactively official bilateral lenders to come to the table early to work with borrower countries to minimize periods of debt distress the imf must refocus its lending on addressing balance of payment problems and its lending should be temporary when done responsibly imf lending is at the very core of its contribution to the global economy when markets fail the imf steps in and makes resources available in exchange countries implement economic reforms to resolve their balance of payments issues and support economic growth the reforms undertaken during these programs are some of the imf's most important contributions to a strong sustainable and balanced global economy argentina is a fitting example i was in argentina earlier this month to demonstrate the united states support for the imf efforts to help the country reset financially argentina deserves the imf support because the country is making real progress toward meeting financial benchmarks but not every country is so deserving the imf must hold countries accountable for implementing economic reforms and sometimes sometimes the imf needs to say no the organization has no obligation to lend to countries that fail to implement reforms economic stability and growth should be the markers of the imf success not how much money the institution lends out world bank like the imf the world bank must be made fit for purpose again the world bank group helps developing countries grow their economies reduce poverty increase private investment support private sector job creation and reduce dependence on foreign aid it offers transparent and affordable long term financing for countries to invest in their own development priorities the bank along with the fund provides extensive technical support to promote debt sustainability among low income countries which empowers those countries to stand up to coercive and opaque lending terms from other creditors these core functions of the world bank complement the trump administration's efforts to foster safer stronger and more prosperous economies in the united states and the world but the bank like the imf has strayed in certain respects from its initial mission the bank should no longer expect blank checks for rapid buzzword centric marketing accompanied by half hearted commitments to reform as the bank returns to its core mission it must use its resources as efficiently and effectively as possible and it must do so in ways that demonstrate tangible values for all member countries the bank can use its resources more efficiently now by focusing on increasing energy access business leaders the world over identify unreliable power supply as one of the primary impediments to investment the world bank and african development bank's joint mission 300 initiative to expand energy access to 300,000,000 more people in africa is a welcome effort but the world bank must respond to country's energy priorities and needs and focus on dependable technologies that can sustain economic growth rather than seek to meet distortionary climate finance targets we applaud the recent announcement that the world bank will seek to remove prohibitions on support for nuclear energy which could revolutionize energy supply for many emerging markets we encourage the bank to go further in giving countries access to all technologies that can provide affordable base load generation the world bank must be tech neutral and prioritize affordability and energy investment in most cases this means investing in gas and other fossil fuel based energy production in other cases this may mean investing in renewable energy coupled with systems to help manage the intermittency of wind and solar the history of humanity teaches a simple lesson energy abundance sparks economic abundance that's why the bank should encourage an all of the above approach to energy development such an approach will make world bank financing more effective and it will reconnect the bank to its core mission of economic growth and poverty alleviation in addition to increasing energy access the world bank can use its resources more effectively by starting to apply its graduation policy this would allow the bank to focus on lending to poor less credit worthy countries this is where world bank support makes the biggest difference for poverty and growth instead the world bank continues to lend every year to countries that have met the criteria to graduate from world bank borrowing there is no justification for this continued lending it siphons off resources from higher priorities and crowds out the development of private markets it also disincentivizes country's efforts to move away from dependency on the world bank and toward job rich private sector led growth going forward the the bank must set firm graduation timelines for countries that have long since met the graduation criteria treating china the second largest country in the world as a developing country is absurd while it has been at the expense of many western markets china's rise has been rapid and impressive if china wants to play a role in the global economy commensurate with its actual importance then the country needs to graduate up we welcome that the world bank should also implement transparent procurement policies based on best value it must help countries move away from procurement approaches that prioritize only the lowest cost bids such procurement policies reward distortive and subsidized industrial policies that undermine development they may also stifle the private sector and incentivize corruption and collusion and result in greater long term cost procurement policies based on best value are better from both an efficiency and development perspective and their robust implementation will benefit the bank and its shareholders related to this subject i wish to send a strong i emphasize strong message about procurement policies as regards ukraine no one who finance or supply the russian war machine will be eligible for funds earmarked for ukraine's reconstruction no one to conclude i invite our allies to work with us as we rebalance the international financial system refocus the imf and world bank on their founding charters america first means we are doubling down on our engagement with the international economic system including at the imf and the world bank a more sustainable economic system will be one that better serves the interest in the united states and all the other participants in the system we look forward to working with all of you in this endeavor thank you

**Speaker 1:** good job thank you mister secretary thank you for joining us here today and thank all of you for coming here today i'm gonna point out that you're you have many great lines in this very meaty and comprehensive set of remarks but you say i wish to be clear america first does not mean america alone to the contrary far from stepping back you seek to expand us leadership in international institution like dying and the world bank i must say there's a collective sigh of relief across this town right now because the concern coming into this week is that you were gonna do exactly what you said you're not gonna do which is the us withdrawal but you want to lead what you're asking for is simply getting back to factory settings right focused approach and deal with the issues that you see are most paramount correct

**Speaker 0:** correct as i said in my confirmation hearings i think us engagement with the international financial multilateral institutions we should engage and we should be in it to win it for the american people and for the the rest of the countries and for the client countries

**Speaker 1:** 20 ago a senior us treasury official gave a speech very similar to this calling on the imf and said the imf was asleep at the wheel and dealing with imbalances hank paulson started the strategic economic dialogue with the chinese every treasury secretary since then have had an approach so how will you do this differently and how do you think that you'll proceed in this this approach what is your philosophy what is your tools and how will you execute on this

**Speaker 0:** well look i i think that our our moves toward re reordering the financial or trading system is a start i i think that today as i reaffirm our engagement but set up a list of core principles and back to basics for the institutions and again to see timelines that as you and i were talking about backstage global rebalancing has been a topic for more than twenty years long time and you know it's some countries may have a hundred year perspective we don't

**Speaker 1:** right china obviously is an important part of this administration's form and economic policy you'll be meeting with your chinese counterparts what will you tell them in the sense of how they they obviously are aware that there's huge imbalances their manufacturing capacity is enormous especially in things like automobiles how will you help them understand that it's not just about talking it's about executing

**Speaker 0:** well i look i i don't think i have to help them understand i i think they understand very well and it it's just a matter of impetus and will so i believe i first went to japan in 1990 '90 '1 within twelve months of the peak of the bubble a decade yeah of that unwind a decade of malaise and then in 02/2012 i i ran across a foe 02/2011 he was running for prime minister named shinzo abe and he knew that japan needed change and implemented it very quickly ten years later more than ten years later japan has had a remarkable economic run and i think that they are chinese counterparts that will come to this realization and some some of our policies sometimes it takes an external push right alternatively what what i have said previously there is an opportunity for a big deal here that the us is looking to rebalance two more manufacturing the identity of that would be less consumption if china is serious on less dependence on export led manufacturing growth and a rebalancing toward a domestic economy i think they use the term dual circulation well it's right now it's really singular circulation and if they want to rebalance let's do it together this is an incredible opportunity you know i i think if bridgewater founder ray dalio were to write something he could call it a beautiful rebalancing

**Speaker 1:** indeed but a big part of that will also be our own fiscal imbalance and as you mentioned we're running down to 6% of gdp at the top of the cycle not sustainable as you yourself have pointed out how important is it to also address our fiscal imbalance as part of this larger rebalancing

**Speaker 0:** well it's it's very important that i think most people in this room are trained economists and every everyone knows that a trade deficit emanates from three three things external trade policies which we are intent on addressing and you know the external trade policies can be tariffs non tariff barriers currency manipulation and the subsidy of state subsidy of labor and means of production so trade terms of trade or trade regulation is one two is our budget deficit so the the larger our deficit the more the it it creates a demand suck also pushes up the interest rates and then three the level of the dollar the us we continue to have a strong dollar policy and the the dollar will adjust based on markets everyone asked me well what does a strong dollar mean and to me the strong dollar means having the policies in place to they deserve capital flows and have confidence but it doesn't mean that the the price on the the bloomberg screen every day and it it also has different meanings in in terms of bilateral right the prices so so it's really three pronged but tim to your your question i i have talked about we did not get here quickly with the spending the us does not have a revenue problem we have a spending problem and i have suggested when i first met president trump to talk about joining his campaign two years ago that we need to get back to a long term sustainable budget deficit of something with the three in front of it which which works we have 2% nominal growth or 2% inflation projected 1.8% growth which i think could be much higher if if we implement our economic policies

**Speaker 1:** now you reaffirm the strong dollar policy first articulated by bob rubin valerie giscard just saying in the nineteen sixties talked about us exorbitant privilege of the dollar there are some in this town who question that privilege and actually see it as a burden do you see it as a privilege

**Speaker 0:** that the that the us sits at the center the of the the global economy is enabled by the the use of dollars and that it's natural that the usage would come down over time and i think that the us will always for my lifetime be the reserve currency i actually they am not sure that anyone else wants it i i can't remember one of the european officials said today may maybe it was mister de gwingos i can't remember said oh well the euro could become a second reserve currency well you know we just had a substantial appreciation in the euro for export economies it it's a it's a lot of pressure and look i i think that the reaffirming our our belief in these international institutions is also part of that

**Speaker 1:** you mentioned you mentioned the euro you mentioned in your comments mario draghi's report from last year there was a letter report before that i've been spending a lot of time in europe there does seem to be a much more a buoyant atmosphere in europe they see this as a as an opportunity for them i said something about a post renaissance that was heckled a bit but i actually am pretty positive on europe do you think this is an opportunity to shift some of that demand the world has relied on us final demand to shift some of that demand for europe is this a a positive time for europe

**Speaker 0:** look i i i think it can be and it it it wasn't in a straight line it wasn't always the the way a trained diplomat would have done but i think we should all congratulate president trump he he has done what a succession of european leaders have tried to do for the past twenty six years since the advent of the euro that whether it's the french the italians other european countries have tried to get the germany to increase their fiscal spend and drive the european economy and that i i applaud these nascent efforts because it's a combination it's a combination of economic stimulus and it is a combination of burden sharing on the european continent for defense and you know as i said many times before economic security is national security national security is economic security so if if if this european plan works then i i i applaud it i had a private meeting with the spanish finance minister last week two weeks ago and he said you're gonna be pleasantly surprised with where we go on military spending and that this two percent number today he was right

**Speaker 1:** so you're already taking on the these tasks you have china more consumption less investment deal with their manufacturing excess capacity europe's an great opportunity us rebalancing here including on fiscal so what do you want the imf to do what would you like to hear from kristalina over the next couple of days or the board in the new direction of again back to factory settings direction what do you what do you wanna hear from them

**Speaker 0:** well again i i think it's just been mission creep

**Speaker 1:** yeah

**Speaker 0:** and you know just occasionally you have to trim your garden when the weeds grow and i i think that it it it's it's back to basics what are our priorities and how are we going to judge success

**Speaker 1:** in the world bank you discussed about graduating the medium sized countries that should have graduated some time ago that changes the the the commercial model of the world bank but obviously you think that's important they need to be graduated

**Speaker 0:** yes yeah i i mean it's just as president trump says it's common sense that if that you can't have the second largest economy in the world and they it's it's as i said in my speech i i applaud their rapid growth but you don't get both there is i i have a teenager who sometimes wants to be treated like a child sometimes wants to be treated like an adult and yeah they you know i

**Speaker 1:** got one of those too

**Speaker 0:** yeah yeah yeah the the it's an adult economy

**Speaker 1:** you mentioned energies specifically nuclear during the campaign and since you've become secretary you've talked about energy production is one of your important legs the us produces about 30,000,000 barrels of oil a day and the largest producer in the world what more do we need to do here and how can the world bank

**Speaker 0:** what

**Speaker 1:** do they need to do more to encourage fossil fuels as well as nuclear and i assume all the above

**Speaker 0:** yeah look the kind of this the sine qua non for economic growth is energy abundance and we need to drive the the right combination of the crawl walk run for these countries in in charge in terms of sustainable production but by sustainable i mean robust and base load not some the what i would call almost a luxury belief that that we have in the west like they they are worried about pumping water they are worried about heating their homes running their hospitals and you know we we've seen that you know the intermittency doesn't work you know e even kind of in middle developed countries the maybe like south africa that seems to have rolling blackouts

**Speaker 1:** right

**Speaker 0:** so if we that's not a model we want to have a model of strong base load and then bolting on the alternative production as opposed to beginning with alternative production and then having this latency or intermittency that makes it impossible to industrialize

**Speaker 1:** in the final minute or two let me just turn to financial intermediation you know there's a famous adage that capitalism without capital is just another ism the institutions you see here are important intermediaries both in the capital markets and in in other forms of financial intermediation what is your vision especially for the us in terms of financial regulation what do you want the industry to look like obviously the capital markets of the us is the crown jewel of this economy how should we encourage that not only here but abroad

**Speaker 0:** well i look i i i think that i've been getting a lot of questions on private credit and i think that private credit is an interesting addition to the the the us mosaic and it it is the the the depth and breadth of our capital and credit markets that powers the us economy and it it's the innovation there i think that private credit's a very new and interesting part but it it is happening outside of the regulated ecosystem right and i i always like to say i'm not an economist i'm an economic historian and i think we're that is a distortion of the system and it tells me that the post 2,008 regulatory corset is too tight right on the regulated institutions and we want to deregulate them or make them more able to provide the opportunity to lend to the american economy and perhaps into the international economy in a smart safe and sound way as we've seen the history of financial crisis is a overreaction on one side and i think that we had a regulatory overreaction i convened something in the us called fsoc the financial stability oversight council which convenes the regulators and i think through partnership with the three us banking regulators of federal reserve comptroller of the currency and the fdic we can come up with a system that makes the the regulated financial system prosper again and what what the us has that is different than most other g seven countries is just the number of financial institutions we we don't have five big banks three big banks and in in the us the community and small banks which are provide 70% of agricultural lending

**Speaker 1:** right

**Speaker 0:** 40% of small business lending 40% of real estate lending and in the us we we've had this incredible boom on wall street i think wall street can continue doing well but i think it's main street's turn to share in the prosperity and i think it was the pullback by the small banks they opposed the gfc that's kinda created this stagnation on main street and we're we're determined to fix that

**Speaker 1:** mister i always say treasury is the sober voice of reason what we've heard today from you is a sober voice of reason we wish you all the best ladies and gentlemen round of applause to treasury secretary

**Speaker 0:** thank you
